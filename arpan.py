- To meet regulatory compliance and operating license commitments in various jurisdictions, **abc** is required to submit reports to external regulators across the globe.  
- There is a constant increase in changes to external reporting submissions, driven by either external regulatory changes or internal initiatives by **abc**.  
- This results in significant costs for **abc** across various teams as we strive for regulatory compliance.  
- Additionally, there is a notable shortage of SME (Subject Matter Expert) availability.  
- Typical SMEs across various teams perform the following tasks (non-exhaustive):
    - Review and summarize regulatory guidance, sometimes translating local language to English.  
    - Assess impact of changes outlined due to internal or external initiatives.  
    - Formulate data, functional, and non-functional specifications for the technology team to implement.  
    - Review **abc** data products and taxonomies to generate mapping rules for regulatory reports.  
    - Produce code for data mapping rules.  
    - Formulate and execute testing strategy for the developed logic.

- **Reg Reimagine** aims to serve as a virtual SME assistant and collaboration platform, leveraging prior regulatory reporting knowledge.  
- The project team will register initiatives and request support for tasks like impact assessment, data specifications, or rule generation.  
- The virtual SME will generate drafts for these tasks.  
- Teams will review and give feedback, refining the SMEâ€™s intelligence over time.  
- This will simplify and accelerate implementation of mandatory regulatory reporting changes.
