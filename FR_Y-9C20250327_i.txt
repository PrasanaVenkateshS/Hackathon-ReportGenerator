Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
Instructions for Preparation of
Consolidated Financial Statements for 
Holding Companies
Reporting Form FR Y-9C
Effective April 2025

Contents for
Y-9C Instructions
Organization of the Instruction Book
The instruction book is divided into three sections:
(1) The General Instructions describing overall report-
ing requirements.
(2) The Line Item Instructions for each schedule of
the report for the consolidated holding company.
(3) The Glossary presenting, in alphabetical order, deﬁ-
nitions and discussions of accounting treatments
under generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) and other topics that require more extensive
treatment than is practical to include in the line item
instructions or that are relevant to several line items
or to the overall preparation of these reports.
In determining the required treatment of particular trans-
actions or portfolio items or in determining the deﬁni-
tions and scope of the various items, the General Instruc-
tions, the line item instructions, and the Glossary (all of
which are extensively cross-referenced) must be used
jointly. A single section does not necessarily give the
complete instructions for completing all the items of the
reports. The instructions and deﬁnitions in section (2) are
not necessarily self-contained; reference to more detailed
treatments in the Glossary may be needed. However, the
Glossary is not, and is not intended to be, a com-
prehensive discussion of accounting principles or
reporting.
Additional copies of this instruction book may be obtained
from the Federal Reserve Bank in the district where the
reporting holding company submits its FR Y-9C reports,
or may be found on the Federal Reserve Board’s public
website (www.federalreserve.gov).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF
Financial Statements for
Holding Companies
For purposes of this report, all references to “bank(s)” and “associated bank(s)” are
inclusive of “savings association(s)” unless otherwise noted.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
Who Must Report
A. Reporting Criteria
All bank holding companies, savings and loan holding
companies,1 securities holding companies and U.S. inter-
mediate holding companies (collectively “holding com-
panies”), regardless of size, are required to submit ﬁnan-
cial statements to the Federal Reserve, unless speciﬁcally
exempted (see description of exemptions below). Certain
SLHCs are exempt from ﬁling the FR Y-9C and the
FR Y-9SP report and would ﬁle the FR 2320 report.2
The speciﬁc reporting requirements for each holding
company depend upon the size of the holding company,
or other speciﬁc factors as determined by the appropriate
Federal Reserve Bank. Holding companies must ﬁle the
appropriate forms as described below:
(1) Holding Companies with Total ConsolidatedAssets
of $3 billion or More. Holding companies with total
consolidated assets of $3 billion or more (the top tier
of a multi-tiered holding company, when applicable)
must ﬁle:
(a) the Consolidated Financial Statements for Hold-
ing Companies (FR Y-9C) quarterly, as of the last
calendar day of March, June, September, and
December.
(b) the Parent Company Only Financial Statements
for Large Holding Companies (FR Y-9LP) quar-
terly, as of the last calendar day of March, June,
September, and December.
Each holding company that ﬁles the FR Y-9C
must submit the FR Y-9LP for its parent company.
For tiered holding companies. When holding com-
panies with total consolidated assets of $3 billion, or
more, own or control, or are owned or controlled by,
other holding companies (i.e., are tiered holding
companies), only the top-tier holding company must
ﬁle the FR Y-9C for the consolidated holding com-
pany organization unless the top-tier holding com-
pany is exempt from reporting the FR Y-9C. If a
top-tier holding company is exempt from reporting
the FR Y-9C, then the lower-tier holding company
(with total consolidated assets of $3 billion or more)
must ﬁle the FR Y-9C.
In addition, such tiered holding companies, regard-
less of the size of the subsidiary holding companies,
must also submit, or have the top-tier holding com-
pany subsidiary submit, a separate FR Y-9LP for
each lower-tier holding company of the top-tier
holding company.
(2) Holding Companies that are Employee Stock Own-
ership Plans. Holding companies that are employee
stock ownership plans (ESOPs) as of the last calendar
day of the calendar year must ﬁle the Financial
Statements for Employee Stock Ownership Plan Hold-
ing Companies (FR Y-9ES) on an annual basis, as of
December 31. No other FR Y-9 series form is required.
However, holding companies that are subsidiaries of
1. Savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) do not include any
trust (other than a pension, proﬁt-sharing, stockholders’ voting, or business
trust) which controls a savings association if such trust by its terms must
terminate within 25 years or not later than 21 years and 10 months after the
death of individuals living on the effective date of the trust, and (a) was in
existence and in control of a savings association on June 26, 1967, or, (b) is
a testamentary trust. See Section 238.2 of the interim ﬁnal rule for more
information.
2. The following SLHCs are exempt: (1) any grandfathered unitary
SLHC with primarily commercial assets and thrifts that make up less than
5 percent of its consolidated assets; and (2) any SLHC that primarily holds
insurance-related assets and does not otherwise submit ﬁnancial reports
with the SEC pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.
FR Y9C
GEN-1
General Instructions
June 2021

ESOP holding companies (i.e., a tiered holding com-
pany) must submit the appropriate FR Y-9 series in
accordance with holding company reporting require-
ments.
(3) Holding Companies with Total ConsolidatedAssets
of Less Than $3 billion. Holding companies with
total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion must
ﬁle the Parent Company Only Financial Statements
for Small Holding Companies (FR Y-9SP) on a
semiannual basis, as of the last calendar day of June
and December.3
For tiered holding companies. When holding com-
panies with total consolidated assets of less than
$3 billion, own or control, or are owned or controlled
by, other holding companies (i.e., are tiered holding
companies), the top-tier holding company must ﬁle
the FR Y-9SP for the top-tier parent company of the
holding company. In addition, such tiered holding
companies must also submit, or have the holding
company subsidiary submit, a separate FR Y-9SP for
each lower-tier holding company.
When a holding company that has total consolidated
assets of less than $3 billion is a subsidiary of a
holding company that ﬁles the FR Y-9C, the holding
company that has total consolidated assets of less
than $3 billion would report on the FR Y-9LP rather
than the FR Y-9SP.
The instructions for the FR Y-9LP, FR Y-9ES, and the
FR Y-9SP are not included in this booklet but may be
obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank in the district
where the holding company ﬁles its reports, or may be
found on the Federal Reserve Board’s public website
(www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms).
B. Exemptions from Reporting the
Holding Company Financial
Statements
The following holding companies do not have to ﬁle
holding company ﬁnancial statements:
(1) a holding company that has been granted an exemp-
tion under Section 4(d) of the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act; or
(2) a “qualiﬁed foreign banking organization” as deﬁned
by Section 211.23(a) of Regulation K (12 CFR
211.23(a)) that controls a U.S. subsidiary bank.
Holding companies that are not required to ﬁle under the
above criteria may be required to ﬁle this report by the
Federal Reserve Bank of the district in which they are
registered.
C. Shifts in Reporting Status
A top-tier holding company that reaches $3 billion or
more in total consolidated assets as of June 30 of the
preceding year must begin reporting the FR Y-9C and the
FR Y-9LP in March of the current year, and any lower-
tier holding companies must begin reporting the FR
Y-9LP in March of the current year. If a top-tier holding
company reaches $3 billion or more in total consolidated
assets due to a business combination, a transaction
between entities under common control, or a branch
acquisition that is not a business combination, then the
holding company must begin reporting the FR Y-9C and
the FR Y-9LP with the ﬁrst quarterly report date follow-
ing the effective date of the business combination, a
transaction between entities under common control, or
branch acquisition, and any lower-tier holding companies
must begin reporting the FR Y-9LP with the ﬁrst quar-
terly report date following the effective date. In general,
once a holding company reaches or exceeds $3 billion in
total consolidated assets and begins ﬁling the FR Y-9C
and FR Y-9LP, it should ﬁle a complete FR Y-9C and FR
Y-9LP going forward (and any lower-tier holding com-
panies should ﬁle a complete FR Y-9LP going forward).
If a holding company’s total consolidated assets should
subsequently fall to less than $3 billion for four consecu-
tive quarters, then the holding company may revert to
3. The Reserve Bank with whom the reporting holding company ﬁles its
reports may require that a holding company with total consolidated assets
of less than $3 billion submit the FR Y-9C and the FR Y-9LP reports to
meet supervisory needs. Reserve Banks will consider such criteria includ-
ing, but not limited to, whether the holding company (1) is engaged in
signiﬁcant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank
subsidiary; (2) conducts signiﬁcant off-balance-sheet activities, including
securitizations or managing or administering assets for third parties, either
directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; or (3) has a material amount of
debt or equity securities (other than trust preferred securities) outstanding
that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, any holding company that is not subject to the Federal
Reserve’s Capital Adequacy Guidelines, but nonetheless elects to comply
with the guidelines, are required to ﬁle a complete FR Y-9C and FR Y-9LP
report, and generally would not be permitted to revert back to ﬁling the FR
Y-9SP report in any subsequent periods.

ﬁling the FR Y-9SP (and any lower-tier holding compa-
nies in those organizations may revert to ﬁling the
FR Y-9SP).
Where to Submit the Reports
Electronic Submission
All holding companies must submit their completed
reports electronically. Holding companies should contact
their district Reserve Bank or go to www.frbservices.org/
centralbank/reportingcentral/index.html for procedures
for electronic submission.
A holding company should contact the appropriate
Reserve Bank if it believes it may not be able to submit
the FR Y-9C electronically.
When to Submit the Reports
The Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Com-
panies (FR Y-9C) are required to be submitted as of
March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. The
submission date for holding companies is 40 calendar
days after the March 31, June 30, and September 30 as of
dates unless that day falls on a weekend or holiday
(subject to timely ﬁling provisions). The submission date
for holding companies is 45 calendar days after the
December 31 as of date. For example, the June 30 report
must be received by August 9, and the December 31 report
by February 14.
The term “submission date” is deﬁned as the date by
which the Federal Reserve must receive the holding
company’s FR Y-9C.
If the submission deadline falls on a weekend or holiday,
the report must be received on the ﬁrst business day after
the Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. Earlier submission aids
the Federal Reserve in reviewing and processing the
reports and is encouraged. No extensions of time for
submitting reports are granted.
The reports are due by the end of the reporting day on
the submission date (5:00 P.M. at each district Reserve
Bank).
How to Prepare the Reports
A. Applicability of GAAP, Consolidation
Rules and SEC Consistency
Holding companies are required to prepare and ﬁle the
Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Compa-
nies in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) and these instructions. All reports
shall be prepared in a consistent manner. The holding
company’s ﬁnancial records shall be maintained in such a
manner and scope so as to ensure that the Consolidated
Financial Statements for Holding Companies can be
prepared and ﬁled in accordance with these instructions
and reﬂect a fair presentation of the holding company’s
ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
Holding companies should retain workpapers and other
records used in the preparation of these reports.
A holding company that is a private company, as deﬁned
in U.S. GAAP (and discussed in the Glossary entry for
“public business entity”), is permitted to use private
company accounting alternatives issued by the FASB
when preparing its FR Y-9C report. If the Federal
Reserve determines that a particular accounting principle
within U.S. GAAP, including a private company account-
ing alternative, is inconsistent with the statutorily speci-
ﬁed supervisory objectives, the Federal Reserve may
prescribe an accounting principle for regulatory reporting
purposes that is no less stringent than U.S. GAAP. In such
a situation, a holding company would not be permitted to
use that particular private company accounting alterna-
tive or other accounting principle within U.S. GAAP for
FR Y-9C purposes. The Federal Reserve would provide
appropriate notice in the event an accounting alternative
or accounting principle was disallowed.
Subsequent Events
Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur
after the FR Y-9C balance sheet date, e.g., December 31,
but before the FR Y-9C report is ﬁled. Consistent with
ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events (formerly FASB
Statement No. 165 ‘‘Subsequent Events’’), an institution
shall recognize in the FR Y-9C report the effects of all
subsequent events (not addressed in other ASC Topics)
that provide additional evidence about conditions that
existed at the date of the FR Y-9C balance sheet (Sched-
ule HC) including the estimates inherent in the process of
preparing the FR Y-9C report e.g., a loss that has been
incurred but not yet conﬁrmed as of the FR Y-9C report
balance sheet date.
Scope of the “consolidated holding
company” to be reported in the submitted
reports
For purposes of this report, the holding company should
consolidate its subsidiaries on the same basis as it does
General Instructions
FR Y9C
GEN-3
General Instructions
September 2021

for its annual reports to the SEC or, for those holding
companies that do not ﬁle reports with the SEC, on the
same basis as described in generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP). Generally, under the rules for con-
solidation established by the SEC and by GAAP, holding
companies should consolidate any company in which it
owns more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting
stock.
Each holding company shall account for any investments
in unconsolidated subsidiaries, associated companies,
and those corporate joint ventures over which the holding
company exercises signiﬁcant inﬂuence according to the
equity method of accounting, as prescribed by GAAP.
The equity method of accounting is described in Sched-
ule HC, item 8. (Refer to the Glossary entry for ‘‘subsid-
iaries’’ for the deﬁnitions of the terms subsidiary, associ-
ated company, and corporate joint venture.)
Rules of Consolidation
For purposes of these reports, all offices (i.e., branches,
subsidiaries, VIEs, and IBFs) that are within the scope of
the consolidated holding company as deﬁned above are
to be reported on a consolidated basis. Unless the instruc-
tions speciﬁcally state otherwise, this consolidation shall
be on a line-by-line basis, according to the caption
shown. As part of the consolidation process, the results of
all transactions and all intercompany balances (e.g.,
outstanding asset/debt relationships) between offices,
subsidiaries, and other entities included in the scope of
the consolidated holding company are to be eliminated in
the consolidation and must be excluded from the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements for Holding Companies. (For
example, eliminate in the consolidation (1) loans made
by the holding company to a consolidated subsidiary and
the corresponding liability of the subsidiary to the hold-
ing company, (2) a consolidated subsidiary’s deposits in
another holding company consolidated subsidiary and the
corresponding cash or interest-bearing asset balance of
the subsidiary, and (3) the intercompany interest income
and expense related to such loans and deposits of the
holding company and its consolidated subsidiary.)
Exception: For purposes of reporting the total assets of
captive insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries in Sched-
ule HC-M, Memoranda, items 7(a) and 7(b), only, hold-
ing companies should measure the subsidiaries’ total
assets before eliminating intercompany transactions
between the consolidated subsidiary and other offices or
subsidiaries of the consolidated holding company. Other-
wise, captive insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries
should be reported on a consolidated basis as described in
the preceding paragraph.
Subsidiaries of Subsidiaries. For a subsidiary of a hold-
ing company that is in turn the parent of one or more
subsidiaries:
(1) Each subsidiary shall consolidate its majority-owned
subsidiaries in accordance with the consolidation
requirements set forth above.
(2) Each subsidiary shall account for any investments in
unconsolidated subsidiaries, corporate joint ventures
over which the holding company exercises signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence, and associated companies according
to the equity method of accounting.
Noncontrolling (minority) interests. A noncontrolling
interest, sometimes called a minority interest, is the
portion of equity in a holding company’s subsidiary not
attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent holding
company. Report noncontrolling interests in the reporting
holding company’s consolidated subsidiaries in Sched-
ule HC, item 27(b), “Noncontrolling (minority) interests
in consolidated subsidiaries.” Report the portion of con-
solidated net income reported in Schedule HI, item 12,
that is attributable to noncontrolling interests in consoli-
dated subsidiaries of the holding company in Sched-
ule HI, item 13.
Reporting by type of office (for holding
companies with foreign offices)
Some information in the Consolidated Financial State-
ments for Holding Companies are to be reported by type
of office (e.g., for domestic offices or for foreign offices)
as well as for the consolidated holding company. Where
information is called for by type of office, the information
reported shall be the office component of the consoli-
dated item unless otherwise speciﬁed in the line item
instructions. That is, as a general rule, the office informa-
tion shall be reported at the same level of consolidation
as the fully consolidated statement, shall reﬂect only
transactions with parties outside the scope of the consoli-
dated holding company, and shall exclude all transactions
between offices of the consolidated holding company as
deﬁned above. See the Glossary entries for “domestic
office” and “foreign office” for the deﬁnitions of these
terms.

Exclusions from coverage of the
consolidated report
Subsidiaries where control does not rest with the par-
ent. If control of a majority-owned subsidiary by the
holding company does not rest with the holding company
because of legal or other reasons (e.g., the subsidiary is in
bankruptcy), the subsidiary is not required to be consoli-
dated for purposes of the report.3 Thus, the holding
company’s investments in such subsidiaries are not elimi-
nated in consolidation but will be reﬂected in the reports
in the balance sheet item for ‘‘Investments in unconsoli-
dated subsidiaries and associated companies’’ (Schedule
HC, item 8) and other transactions of the holding com-
pany with such subsidiaries will be reﬂected in the
appropriate items of the reports in the same manner as
transactions with unrelated outside parties. Additional
guidance on this topic is provided in accounting stan-
dards, including ASC Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation –
Overall (formerly FASB Statement No. 94, Consolida-
tion of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries).
Custody accounts. All custody and safekeeping activities
(i.e., the holding of securities, jewelry, coin collections,
and other valuables in custody or in safekeeping for
customers) should not to be reﬂected on any basis in the
balance sheet of the Consolidated Financial Statements
for Holding Companies unless cash funds held by the
bank in safekeeping for customers are commingled with
the general assets of the reporting holding company. In
such cases, the commingled funds would be reported in
the Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Com-
panies as deposit liabilities of the holding company.
For holding companies that ﬁle ﬁnancial statements with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), major
classiﬁcations including total assets, total liabilities, total
equity capital and net income should generally be the
same between the FR Y-9C report ﬁled with the Federal
Reserve and the ﬁnancial statements ﬁled with the SEC.
B. Report Form Captions, Non-applicable
Items and Instructional Detail
No caption on the report forms shall be changed in any
way. An amount or a zero should be entered for all items
except in those cases where (1) the reporting holding
company does not have any foreign offices; (2) the
reporting company does not have any depository institu-
tions that are subsidiaries other than commercial banks;
or (3) the reporting holding company has no consoli-
dated subsidiaries that render services in any ﬁduciary
capacity and its subsidiary banks have no trust depart-
ments. If the reporting holding company has only domes-
tic offices, Schedule HC, items 13(b)(1) and 13(b)(2),
and Schedule HI, items 1(a)(2) and 2(a)(2) should be left
blank. If the reporting company does not have any
depository institutions that are subsidiaries other than
commercial banks, then Schedule HC-E, items 2(a)
through 2(e) should be left blank. If the reporting com-
pany does not have any trust activities, then Schedule HI,
item 5(a) should be left blank. A holding company
should leave blank memorandum items 9(a) through 9(d)
of Schedule HI if the reporting holding company does
not have average trading assets of $2 million or more
(reported on Schedule HC-K, item 4(a)) as of the
March 31st report date of the current calendar year.
Holding companies who are not required to report Sched-
ule HC-D or Schedule HC-Q may leave these schedules
blank. Savings and loan holding companies who are not
required to report Schedule HC-L, item 7(c)(1)(a)
through item 7(c)(2)(c), or all of Schedule HC-R may
leave these items blank.
There may be areas in which a holding company wishes
more technical detail on the application of accounting
standards and procedures to the requirements of these
instructions. Such information may often be found in the
appropriate entries in the Glossary section of these
instructions or, in more detail, in the GAAP standards.
Selected sections of the GAAP standards are referenced
in the instructions where appropriate. The accounting
entries in the Glossary are intended to serve as an aid in
speciﬁc reporting situations rather than a comprehensive
statement on accounting for holding companies.
Questions and requests for interpretations of matters
appearing in any part of these instructions should be
addressed to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank (that
is, the Federal Reserve Bank in the district where the
holding company submits this report).
C. Rounding
For holding companies with total assets of less than $10
billion, all dollar amounts must be reported in thousands,
with the ﬁgures rounded to the nearest thousand. Items
less than $500 will be reported as zero. For holding
companies with total assets of $10 billion or more, all
dollar amounts may be reported in thousands, but each
General Instructions
FR Y9C
GEN-5
General Instructions
December 2014

holding company, at its option, may round the ﬁgures
reported to the nearest million, with zeros reported for the
thousands. For holding companies exercising this option,
amounts less than $500,000 will be reported as zero.
Rounding could result in details not adding to their stated
totals. However, to ensure consistent reporting, the
rounded detail items should be adjusted so that the totals
and the sums of their components are identical.
On the Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding
Companies, “Total assets” (Schedule HC, item 12) and
“Total liabilities and equity capital” (Schedule HC,
item 29), which must be equal, must be derived from
unrounded numbers and then rounded to ensure that these
two items are equal as reported. When reporting numeric
amounts, including dollar amounts, commas should not
be used to separate thousands, millions, and billions.
D. Negative Entries
Except for the items listed below, negative entries are
generally not appropriate on the FR Y-9C’s Balance
Sheet and should not be reported. Hence, assets with
credit balances must be reported in liability items and
liabilities with debit balances must be reported in asset
items, as appropriate, and in accordance with these in-
structions. Items for which negative entries may be made,
include:
(1) Schedule HC, item 8, “Investments in unconsoli-
dated subsidiaries and associated companies.”
(2) Schedule HC, item 9, “Direct and indirect invest-
ments in real estate ventures”
(3) Schedule HC, item 26(a), “Retained earnings.”
(4) Schedule HC, item 26(b), “Accumulated other com-
prehensive income.”
(5) Schedule HC, item 26(c), “Other equity capital
components. ”

E. Conﬁdentiality
The completed version of this report generally is avail-
able to the public upon request on an individual basis
with the exception of any amounts reported in Sched-
ule HI, memoranda item 7(g), “FDIC deposit insurance
assessments,” for report dates beginning June 30, 2009,
Schedule HC, Memorandum item 2b(1), “Name of

ranty reserves for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans
sold to U.S. government agencies and government-
sponsored agencies,” item 7(b), and “Representation and
warranty reserves for 1-4 family residential mortgage
loans sold to other parties.” The CEO contact informa-
tion is for the conﬁdential use of the Board and will not
be released to the public. However, a reporting holding
company may request conﬁdential treatment for items on
the Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Com-
panies (FR Y-9C) that fall, in whole or in part, within the
scope of one or more of the exemptions from disclosure
under the Freedom of Information Act (the “FOIA” – 5
U.S.C. 552) pursuant to the Board’s Rules regarding
Availability of Information, 12 CFR 261.17. The exempt
categories include (but are not limited to) “trade secrets
and commercial or ﬁnancial information obtained from a
person and privileged or conﬁdential” (exemption 4) and
information that, if disclosed, “would constitute a clearly
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy” (exemp-
tion 6). The respondent may request conﬁdential treat-
ment for any information that it believes is exempt from
disclosure under the FOIA. For example, if the applicant
submits commercial or ﬁnancial information that is both
customarily and actually treated as private, or is of the
opinion that information of a personal nature would
result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy, conﬁdential treatment of such information may
be requested pursuant to exemption 4 or 6, respectively.
A request for conﬁdential treatment must be submitted in
writing prior to the electronic submission of the report.
The request must discuss in writing the justiﬁcation for
which conﬁdentiality is requested and must demonstrate
the speciﬁc nature of the harm that would result from
public release of the information. Merely stating that
competitive harm would result or that information is
personal is not sufficient.
Check Box. Holding companies must select on page 1 of
the form whether any conﬁdential treatment is requested
for any portion of the report. If the answer to the ﬁrst
question is “Yes,” the Reporter must indicate whether a
letter justifying the request for conﬁdential treatment is
included with the submission or has been provided
separately. If an institution does not fulﬁll both require-
ments, or does not check the appropriate boxes, conﬁden-
tial treatment will not be considered.
Note: Responses to the questions regarding conﬁden-
tial treatment on page 1 of the form will be considered
public information.
Information, for which conﬁdential treatment is requested,
may subsequently be released by the Federal Reserve
System in accordance with the terms of 12 CFR 261.16,
or otherwise provided by law. The Federal Reserve may
subsequently release information for which conﬁdential
treatment is accorded if the Board of Governors deter-
mines that the disclosure of such information is in the
public interest. If the Federal Reserve deems it necessary
to release conﬁdential data, the reporting institution will
be notiﬁed before it is released.
F. Veriﬁcation and Signatures
Veriﬁcation. All addition and subtraction should be
double-checked before reports are submitted. Totals and
subtotals in supporting materials should be cross-checked
to corresponding items elsewhere in the reports. Before a
report is submitted, all amounts should be compared with
the corresponding amounts in the previous report. If there
are any unusual changes from the previous report, a brief
explanation of the changes should be provided to the
appropriate Reserve Bank.

Signatures. A physical copy of the Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements for Holding Companies must be manu-
ally signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the holding
company (or by the individual performing this equivalent
function). By signing the cover page of this report, the
authorized officer acknowledges that any knowing and
willful misrepresentation or omission of a material fact
may subject the officer to legal sanctions provided by 18
USC 1001 and 1007.
Holding companies must maintain in their ﬁles a physical
copy of the manually signed FR Y-9C submission for a
period of three years following submission. A signature is
not submitted as part of the electronic submission.
G. Amended Reports
When the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of how GAAP
or these instructions should be applied to a speciﬁed
event or transaction (or series of related events or trans-
actions) differs from the reporting holding company’s
interpretation, the Federal Reserve may require the hold-
ing company to reﬂect the event(s) or transaction(s) in its
FR Y-9C in accordance with the Federal Reserve’s
interpretation and to amend previously submitted reports.
The Federal Reserve will consider the materiality of such
event(s) or transaction(s) in making a determination
about requiring the holding company to apply the Federal
Reserve’s interpretation and to amend previously submit-
ted reports. Materiality is a qualitative characteristic of
accounting information that is addressed in Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Concepts State-
ment No. 8, “Conceptual Framework for Financial Repor-
thing,” as follows: “Information is material if omitting it
or misstating it could inﬂuence decisions that users make
on the basis of the ﬁnancial information of a speciﬁc
reporting entity.” In other words, materiality is an entity-
speciﬁc aspect of relevance based on the nature or
magnitude or both of the items to which the information
relates in the context of an individual entity’s ﬁnancial
report.
The Federal Reserve may require the ﬁling of amended
Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Compa-
nies if reports as previously submitted contain signiﬁcant
errors. In addition, a holding company should ﬁle an
amended report when internal or external auditors make
audit adjustments that result in a restatement of ﬁnancial
statements previously submitted to the Federal Reserve.
The Federal Reserve also requests that holding compa-
nies that have restated their prior period ﬁnancial state-
ments as a result of an acquisition submit revised reports
for the prior year-ends. While information to complete all
schedules to the FR Y-9C may not be available, holding
companies are requested to provide the Consolidated
Balance Sheet (Schedule HC) and the Consolidated
Report of Income (Schedule HI) for the prior year-ends.
In the event that certain of the required data are not
available, holding companies should contact the appropri-
ate Reserve Bank for information on submitting revised
reports.

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Consolidated Report of Income
Schedule HI
The line item instructions should be read in conjunction with the Glossary and other
sections of these instructions. See the discussion of the Organization of the Instruction
Books in the General Instructions. For purposes of these line item instructions, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation is
referred to as “ASC.”
General Instructions
Report in accordance with these instructions all income
and expense of the consolidated holding company for the
calendar year-to-date. Include adjustments of accruals
and other accounting estimates made shortly after the end
of a reporting period which relate to the income and
expense of the reporting period.
For qualifying fair value and cash ﬂow hedges, holding
companies should report both of the following in earn-
ings in Schedule HI in the same income statement item
that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged
item:
(1) The change in the fair value of the hedging instru-
ment that is included in the assessment of hedge
effectiveness; and
(2) Amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness in accordance with ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging.
In addition, for qualifying net investment hedges, holding
companies should report amounts reclassiﬁed from accu-
mulated other comprehensive income to earnings in
Schedule HI in the same income statement item that is
used to present the earnings effect of the hedged net
investment.
For further information on fair value, cash ﬂow, and net
investment hedges, see the Glossary entry for “Deriva-
tive Contracts.”
For purposes of this report, a savings and loan holding
company should report income from its savings associa-
tion(s), nonbank subsidiary(s) and subsidiary savings and
loan holding company(s) (as deﬁned in section 238.2 of
Regulation LL) following the same guidelines and
accounting rules set forth in these instructions for all
holding companies.
Holding companies that began operating during the
reporting period should report in the appropriate items of
Schedule HI all income earned and expense incurred
since commencing operations. The holding company
should report pre-opening income earned and expenses
incurred from inception until the date operations com-
menced using one of the two methods described in the
Glossary entry for “Start-up Activities.”
Business Combinations and Transactions between Enti-
ties Under Common Control −If the holding company
entered into a business combination that became effective
during the reporting period and which has been accounted
for under the acquisition method, report the income and
expense of the acquired business only after its acquisi-
tion. If the holding company was involved in a transac-
tion between entities under common control that became
effective during the year-to-date reporting period and has
been accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of
interests, report the income and expense of the combined
entities for the entire calendar year-to-date as though they
had combined at the beginning of the year. For further
information on business combinations and transactions
between entities under common control, see the Glossary
entry for “Business Combinations.”
Assets and liabilities accounted under the fair value
option — Under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) (i.e., ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial
Instruments – Overall, ASC Subtopic 815-15, Deriva-
tives and Hedging – Embedded Derivatives, and ASC
Subtopic 860-50, Transfers and Servicing – Servicing
Assets and Liabilities), the holding company may elect to
report certain assets and liabilities at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings. This elec-
tion is generally referred to as the fair value option. If the
holding company has elected to apply the fair value
option to interest-bearing ﬁnancial assets and liabilities,
it should report the interest income on these ﬁnancial
FR Y-9C
HI-1
Schedule HI
December 2024

assets (except any that are in nonaccrual status) and the
interest expense on these ﬁnancial liabilities for the
year-to-date in the appropriate interest income and inter-
est expense items on Schedule HI, not as part of the
reported change in fair value of these assets and liabilities
for the year-to-date. The holding company should mea-
sure the interest income or interest expense on a ﬁnancial
asset or liability to which the fair value option has been
applied using either the contractual interest rate on the
asset or liability or the effective yield method based on
the amount at which the asset or liability was ﬁrst
recognized on the balance sheet. Although the use of the
contractual interest rate is an acceptable method under
GAAP, when a ﬁnancial asset or liability has a signiﬁcant
premium or discount upon initial recognition, the mea-
surement of interest income or interest expense under the
effective yield method more accurately portrays the
economic substance of the transaction. In addition, in
some cases, GAAP requires a particular method of
interest income recognition when the fair value option is
elected. For example, when the fair value option has been
applied to a beneﬁcial interest in securitized ﬁnancial
assets within the scope of ASC Subtopic 325-40,
Investments-Other – Beneﬁcial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets, interest income should be measured in
accordance with the consensus in this issue. When the
fair value option has been applied to an acquired loan or
debt security under ASC 326-20, “Financial Instruments-
Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized Cost,” interest
income on the loan or debt security should be measured
in accordance with Subtopic 310-10, “Receivables—
Overall,” regardless of whether or not management has
determined the asset to be purchased credit deteriorated
(PCD). For further information, see the Glossary entry
for “Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Assets.”
Revaluation adjustments, excluding amounts reported as
interest income and interest expense, to the carrying
value of all assets and liabilities reported in Schedule HC
at fair value under a fair value option (excluding servic-
ing assets and liabilities reported in Schedule HC,
item 10, “Intangible assets,” and Schedule HC, item 20,
“Other liabilities,” respectively) resulting from the peri-
odic marking of such assets and liabilities to fair value
should be reported as “Other noninterest income” in
Schedule HI, item 5(l).
However, the holding company should report in Sched-
ule HI-A, item 12, “Other comprehensive income,” the
portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability
resulting from a change in the instrument-speciﬁc credit
risk (“own credit risk”) when the holding company has
elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance
with the fair value option for ﬁnancial instruments.
Line Item 1
Interest income.
Line Item 1(a)
Interest and fee income on loans.
Report in the appropriate subitem all interest, fees, and
similar charges levied against or associated with all
assets reportable as loans in Schedule HC-C, items 1
through 9.
Deduct interest rebated to customers on loans paid before
maturity from gross interest earned on loans; do not
report as an expense.
Include as interest and fee income on loans:
(1) Interest on all assets reportable as loans extended
directly, purchased from others, sold under agree-
ments to repurchase, or pledged as collateral for any
purpose.
(2) Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs,
and purchase premiums and discounts on loans held
for investment, all of which should be deferred and
recognized over the life of the related loan as an
adjustment of yield under ASC Subtopic 310-20,
Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs,
as described in the Glossary entry for “Loan Fees.”
See exclusion (3) below.
(3) Loan commitment fees (net of direct loan origination
costs) that must be deferred over the commitment
period and recognized over the life of the related loan
as an adjustment of yield under ASC Subtopic 310-20
as described in the Glossary entry for “Loan Fees.”
(4) Investigation and service charges, fees representing a
reimbursement of loan processing costs, renewal and
past-due charges, prepayment penalties, and fees
charged for the execution of mortgages or agree-
ments securing the holding company’s loans.

the length of time the account has been overdrawn,
the magnitude of the overdrawn balance, or which
are otherwise equivalent to interest. See exclusion (6)

and purchase premiums and discounts on loans held
for sale, all of which should be deferred until the loan
is sold (rather than amortized). The net fees or costs
and purchase premium or discount are part of the

sold, the difference between the sales price and the
recorded investment in the loan is the gain or loss on
the sale of the loan. See exclusion (4) below.

for the purchase of ﬁre insurance on real estate
securing a loan) made by the holding company for
the account of its customers. If the holding com-

amount of such expenditures, the reimbursements
should be credited to the same expense accounts.
(6) Transaction or per item charges levied against deposit
accounts for the processing of checks drawn against
insufficient funds that the holding company assesses
regardless of whether it decides to pay, return, or
hold the check, so-called “NSF check charges”

Include as interest expense on the appropriate category of
deposits ﬁnders’ fees, brokers’ fees, and other fees
related to any type of interest-bearing broker deposit
accounts (e.g., money market deposit accounts) that
represent an adjustment to the interest rate paid on
deposits the reporting bank acquires through brokers. If
these fees are paid in advance and are material they
should be capitalized and amortized over the term of the
related deposits. However, exclude fees levied by brokers
that are, in substance, retainer fees or that otherwise do
not represent an adjustment to the interest rate paid on
brokered deposits e.g., ﬂat fees to administer the account
(report in Schedule HI, item 7(d), “Other noninterest
expense.”
Also include as interest expense the contractual amount
of interest expense incurred on deposits that are reported
at fair value under a fair value option. Deposits with
demand features (e.g., demand and savings deposits in
domestic offices) are generally not eligible for the fair
value option.
Deduct from the gross interest expense of the appropriate
category of time deposits penalties for early withdrawals,
or portions of such penalties, that represent the forfeiture
of interest accrued or paid to the date of withdrawal. If
material, portions of penalties for early withdrawals that
exceed the interest accrued or paid to the date of with-
drawal should not be treated as a reduction of interest
expense but should be included in ‘‘Other noninterest
income’’ in Schedule HI, item 5(l).

year-to-date from the sale, exchange, redemption, or
retirement of all securities reportable in Schedule HC,
item 2(a), ‘‘Held-to-maturity securities.’’ The realized
gain or loss is the difference between the sales price
(excluding interest at the coupon rate accrued since the

Holding companies should adjust the amortized cost of a
held-to-maturity debt security for recoveries of any prior
charge-offs when calculating the realized gain or loss on
a security, such that the recovery of a previously charged
off amount should be recorded before recognizing the
gain.

between the sales price (excluding interest at the coupon
rate accrued since the last interest payment date, if any)
and the amortized cost. If the amount to be reported in
this item is a net loss, report with a minus (-) sign.
Holding companies should adjust the amortized cost of
an available-for-sale debt security for recoveries of any
prior charge-offs when calculating the realized gain or
loss on a security, such that recovery of a previously
charged off amount should be recorded as a credit to the
allowance for credit losses before recognizing the gain.

not be materially different from depreciation based
on the asset’s estimated useful life.
(2) For operating leases accounted for in accordance

Line Item 7(c)(1)
Goodwill impairment losses.
Report any impairment losses recognized during the
period on goodwill (as deﬁned for Schedule HC,
item 10(a)). Exclude goodwill impairment losses associ-
ated with discontinued operations (report such losses on a
net-of-tax basis in Schedule HI, item 11, ‘‘Discontinued
operations, net of applicable income taxes’’).
A holding company that meets the deﬁnition of a private
company in U.S. generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples and has elected the accounting alternative for the
amortization of goodwill in ASC Subtopic 350-20, Intan-
gibles – Goodwill and Other – Goodwill (formerly FASB
Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”), as amended by Accounting Standards Update
No. 2014-02, “Accounting for Goodwill,” should report
the amortization expense of goodwill in this item.
Exclude goodwill amortization expense associated with
discontinued operations (report such expense on a net-of-
tax basis in Schedule HI, item 11, “Discontinued opera-
tions, net of applicable income taxes”). A private com-
pany that elects the accounting alternative for the
subsequent measurement of goodwill should amortize
each amortizable unit of goodwill on a straight-line basis
over ten years (or less than ten years if the private
company demonstrates that another useful life is more
appropriate).
Except when the private company accounting alternative
described above has been elected, goodwill should not be
amortized. However, regardless of whether goodwill is
amortized, it must be tested for impairment as described
in the Glossary entry for “Goodwill.”
Impairment losses on goodwill should be tested at the
consolidated holding company level in accordance with
ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (for-
merly FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets), if there is impairment losses at a
subsidiary level using the subsidiary’s reporting units. If
goodwill impairment loss is recognized at a subsidiary
level, then goodwill of the reporting unit or units (at the
higher consolidated level) in which the subsidiary’s
reporting unit with impaired goodwill resides must be
tested for impairment if the events or conditions that gave
rise to the loss at the subsidiary level would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit (at the
higher consolidated level) below its carrying amount.
Only if goodwill at that higher-level reporting unit is
impaired would a goodwill impairment loss be recog-
nized at the consolidated level.
Goodwill is considered impaired when the amount of
goodwill exceeds its implied fair value at the reporting
unit level. If the carrying amount of reporting unit
goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment
loss must be recognized in earnings in an amount equal to
that excess and reported in this item. The loss recognized
cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recog-
nized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be
its new accounting basis. Subsequent reversal of a previ-
ously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited
once the measurement of that loss is completed.
Goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impair-
ment annually and between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount. Examples of such events or circum-
stances include a signiﬁcant adverse change in the busi-
ness climate, unanticipated competition, a loss of key
personnel, and an expectation that a reporting unit or a
signiﬁcant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or
otherwise disposed of. In addition, goodwill must be
tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been
allocated to a business to be disposed of.
When a reporting unit is to be disposed of in its entirety,
goodwill of that reporting unit must be included in the
carrying amount of the reporting unit in determining the
gain or loss on disposal. When a portion of a reporting
unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of,
goodwill associated with that business must be included
Schedule HI
FR Y-9C
HI-19
Schedule HI
December 2024

in the carrying amount of the business in determining the
gain or loss on disposal. Otherwise, a holding company
may not remove goodwill from its balance sheet, for
example, by “selling” or “dividending” this asset to its
parent holding company or another affiliate.
Line Item 7(c)(2)
Amortization expense and
impairment losses for other intangible assets.
Report the amortization expense of any impairment
losses on “intangible assets” (other than goodwill and
servicing assets) reportable in (Schedule HC-M item
12(c)). Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other (formerly FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets), intangible assets that have
indeﬁnite useful lives should not be amortized but must
be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible
assets that have ﬁnite useful lives must be amortized over
their useful lives and must be reviewed for impairment in
accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and
Equipment (formerly FASB Statement No. 144, Account-
ing for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets).
Exclude the amortization expense of and any impairment
losses on servicing assets, which should be netted against
the
servicing
income
reported
in
Schedule
HI,
item 5(f), ‘‘Net servicing fees,’’ above.
Line Item 7(d)
Other noninterest expense.
Report all operating expenses of the holding company for
the calendar year-to-date not required to be reported
elsewhere in Schedule HI. Disclose in Schedule HI,
Memoranda items 7(a) through 7(p), each component of
other noninterest expense, and the dollar amount of such
component, that is greater than $100,000 and exceeds
7 percent of the other noninterest expense reported in this
item. If net gains have been reported in this item for a
component of “Other noninterest expense,” use the abso-
lute value of such net gains to determine whether the
amount of the net gains is greater than $100,000 and
exceeds 7 percent of “Other noninterest expense” and
should be reported in Schedule HI, Memoranda item 7.
(The absolute value refers to the magnitude of the dollar
amount without regard to whether the amount represents
net gains or net losses.) Preprinted captions have been
provided in Memoranda items 7(a) through 7(m) for
reporting the following components of other noninterest
expense if the component exceeds this disclosure thresh-
old: data processing expenses; advertising and marketing
expenses; directors’ fees; printing, stationery, and sup-
plies; postage; legal fees and expenses; FDIC deposit
insurance assessments; accounting and auditing expenses;
consulting and advisory expenses; automated teller
machine (ATM) and interchange expenses; and telecom-
munications expenses; other real estate owned expense;
and insurance expenses (not included in employee
expense, premises and ﬁxed asset expenses and other real
estate owned expenses). For each component of other
noninterest expense that exceeds this disclosure threshold
for which a preprinted caption has not been provided
describe the component with a clear but concise caption
in Schedule HI, Memoranda items 7(n) through 7(p).
These descriptions should not exceed 50 characters in
length (including spacing between words).
For disclosure purposes in Schedule HI, memoranda
items 7(a) through 7(m), when components of “Other
noninterest expense” reﬂect a single charge for separate
“bundled services” provided by third party vendors,
disclose such amounts in the item with the preprinted
caption that most closely describes the predominant type
of expense incurred, and this categorization should be
used consistently over time.
Include as other noninterest expense:
(1) Fees paid to directors and advisory directors for
attendance at board of directors or committee meet-
ings (including travel and expense allowances).
(Report the amount of such fees in Schedule HI,
Memoranda item 7(c), if this amount is greater than
$100,000 and exceeds 7 percent of the amount
reported in Schedule HI, item 7(d).)
(2) Premiums on ﬁdelity insurance (blanket bond,

for which the holding company or its consolidated
subsidiaries are the beneﬁciary and other insurance
policies for which the premiums are not included in
salaries and employee beneﬁts, expenses of prem-
ises and ﬁxed assets, and expenses of other real
estate owned. (Report the amount of such insurance
expenses in Schedule HI, Memoranda item 7(m), if
this amount is greater than $100,000 and exceeds 7

Report the holding company’s pretax income from con-
tinuing operations before any change in net unrealized
holding gains (losses) on equity securities and any equity
investments not held for trading. This amount will gener-
ally be determined by taking item 3, “Net interest
income,” minus item 4, “Provisions for credit losses”
plus item 5(m), “Total noninterest income,” plus or
minus item 6(a), “Realized gains (losses) on held-to-
maturity securities,” plus or minus item 6(b), “Realized

item 7(e), “Total noninterest expense.” If the result is
negative, report with a minus (-) sign.
NOTE: All holding companies must complete HI,
item 8(b) (i.e. not leave item 8(b) blank), because all
holding companies are now required to have adopted
FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU
2016-01), for FR Y-9C purposes. ASU 2016-01 includes
provisions governing the accounting for investments in
equity securities and eliminates the concept of available-
for-sale equity securities. ASU 2016-01 requires hold-
ings of equity securities (except those accounted for
under the equity method or that result in consolidation),
including other ownership interests (such as interests in
partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures, and limited
liability companies), to be measured at fair value with
changes in the fair value recognized through net income.
However, an institution may choose to measure equity
securities and other equity investments that do not have
readily determinable fair values at cost minus impair-
ment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the

observable price changes during the year-to-date report-
ing period on equity securities and other equity invest-
ments without readily determinable fair values not held
for trading for which this measurement election is made.
Include realized gains (losses) on equity securities and
other equity investments during the year-to-date report-

Memoranda
Line Item M1
Net interest income (item 3 above)
on a fully taxable equivalent basis.
Memo items 1 and 2 are to be completed by holding
companies with $5 billion or more in total assets.
Report net interest income (Schedule HI, item 3 above)
on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The amount reported
in this item should reﬂect what net interest income of the
reporting holding company would be if all its interest
income was subject to federal and state income taxes.
The following accounts on which the interest income is
fully or partially tax-exempt, should be adjusted to a
‘‘taxable equivalent’’ basis in order that the holding
company can compute its net interest income on a fully
taxable equivalent basis:
(1) interest income on tax-exempt obligations (other than
securities) of states and political subdivisions in the
U.S. (included in Schedule HI, item 1(a));
(2) income on tax-exempt securities issued by states and
political subdivisions in the U.S. (included in Sched-
ule HI, item 1(d)(3));
(3) income on lease ﬁnancing receivables that is tax-
exempt (included in Schedule HI, item 1(b)); and
(4) any other interest income (such as interest income
earned on loans to an Employee Stock Ownership
Plan), which under state or federal laws is partially or
in its entirety exempt from income taxes.
The changes to the 1986 Tax Reform Act must be taken
into consideration when computing net interest income
on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The 1986 Act, in
general, disallowed 100% of the interest expense allo-
cable to tax-exempt obligations acquired after August 7,
1986. Previous to that date, and after December 31, 1982,
the disallowance percentage was 20%; previous to Decem-
ber 31, 1982, the disallowance was 0%.
Line Item M2
Net income before applicable
income taxes, and discontinued operations (item 8
above) on a fully taxable equivalent basis.
Report net income before applicable income taxes, and
discontinued operations (item 8 above) on a fully taxable
equivalent basis. The amount reported in this item should
reﬂect what net income of the reporting holding company
would be if all its income was subject to federal and state
income taxes. For purposes of this item, include net
interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis as
reported in memoranda item 1 above plus all other
income and expense adjusted to reﬂect the holding
company’s net income on a fully taxable equivalent
basis.
Line Item M3
Income on tax-exempt loans and
leases to states and political subdivisions in the U.S.
(included in items 1(a) and 1(b) above).
Report the holding company’s best estimate of the
income from all tax-exempt loans and leases extended
to states and political subdivisions in the U.S. that is
included in items 1(a) and 1(b) above.
Tax-exempt loans and leases are those loans and leases to
states and political subdivisions in the U.S. whose income
is excludable from gross income for federal income tax

Income on tax-exempt securities
issued by states and political subdivisions in the U.S.
(included in item 1(d)(3) above).
Report the holding company’s best estimate of the
income from all tax-exempt securities issued by states
and political subdivisions in the U.S. that is included in
item 1(d)(3) above.
Line Item M5
Number of full-time equivalent
employees at end of current period.
Report the number of full-time equivalent employees on
the payroll of the holding company and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the report date.
To convert the number of part-time employees to full-
time equivalent employees, add the total number of hours
all part-time and temporary employees worked during the
quarter ending on the report date and divide this amount
by the number of hours a full-time employee would have
been expected to work during the quarter. Round the
result to the nearest whole number and add it to the
number of full-time employees. (A full-time employee
may be expected to work more or less than 40 hours each
week, depending on the policies of the reporting holding
company.)
Line Item M6
Other noninterest income (only
report amounts greater than $100,000 that exceed
7% of Schedule HI, item 5(l)).
Note: Memo Items 6(a) through 6(j) are to be completed
annually on a calendar year-to-date basis in the Decem-
ber report only by holding companies with less than $5
billion in total assets. Holding companies with greater
than $5 billion in total assets should report these items
on a quarterly basis.
Disclose in memoranda items 6(a) through 6(j) each
component of Schedule HI, item 5(l), “Other noninterest
income,” and the dollar amount of such component, that
is greater than $100,000 and exceeds 7 percent of the
“Other noninterest income.”
Preprinted captions have been provided for the following
categories of “Other noninterest income”:
• M6(a), “Income and fees from the printing and sale of

• M6(e), “Safe deposit box rent,”
• M6(f), “Bank card and credit card interchange fees.”
• M6(g), “Income and fees from wire transfers not
reportable as service charges on deposit accounts.”
Although descriptions of these components of “Other
noninterest income” are included in the instructions for
Schedule HI-5(l), holding companies need not adjust
their internal noninterest income deﬁnitions to match the
descriptions in item 5(l). Rather, holding companies may
report the components of their “Other noninterest income”
using their internal deﬁnitions that reasonably corre-
spond to the preprinted captions provided for this item,
provided the internal deﬁnitions are used consistently
over time.
For other components of “Other noninterest income” that
exceed the disclosure threshold, list and brieﬂy describe
these components in memoranda items 6(h) through 6(j).
For components of ‘‘Other noninterest income’’ that
reﬂect a single credit for separate ‘‘bundled services’’
provided through third party vendors, disclose such
amounts in the item that most closely describes the
predominant type of income earned, and this categoriza-
tion should be used consistently over time.
If net losses have been reported in Schedule HI, item 5(l),
for a component of ‘‘Other noninterest income,’’ use the
absolute value of such net losses to determine whether
the amount of the net losses is greater than $100,000 and
exceeds 7 percent of “Other noninterest income” and
should be reported in this item. (The absolute value refers
to the magnitude of the dollar amount without regard to
whether the amount represents net gains or net losses.) If
net losses are reported in this item, report with a minus (-)

lute value of such net gains to determine whether the
amount of the net gains is greater than $100,000 and
exceeds 7 percent of “Other noninterest expense” and
should be reported in this item. (The absolute value refers
to the magnitude of the dollar amount without regard to
whether the amount represents net gains or net losses.) If

sures. Foreign exchange exposures may arise from cash
instruments (e.g., debt securities) denominated in non-
U.S. currencies and foreign exchange rate contracts.
Foreign exchange rate contracts are those contracts to
purchase foreign (non-U.S.) currencies and U.S. dollar
exchange in the forward market (i.e., on an organized
exchange or in an over-the-counter market). A purchase
of U.S. dollar exchange is equivalent to a sale of foreign
currency. Foreign exchange rate contracts include cross-
currency interest rate swaps where there is an exchange
of principal, forward and spot foreign exchange con-
tracts, and currency futures and currency options.
Line Item M9(c)
Equity security and index
exposures.
Report in this item net gains (losses) from trading cash
instruments and derivative contracts that the reporting
holding company manages as equity security and index
exposures. Equity security or index exposures may arise
from equity securities and equity security or index (i.e.,
equity derivative) contracts. Equity derivative contracts
are contracts that have a return, or a portion of their
return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an
index of equity prices, such as the Standard and
Poor’s 500.
Line Item M9(d)
Commodity and other exposures.
Report in this item net gains (losses) from trading cash
instruments and derivative contracts that the reporting
Schedule HI
HI-28
FR Y-9C
Schedule HI
December 2019

holding company manages as commodity or other expo-
sures. Commodity or other exposures may arise from
commodities and commodity and other derivative con-
tracts not reported as interest rate, foreign exchange,
equity, or credit derivative contracts. Commodity and
other contracts are contracts that have a return, or a
portion of their return, linked to the price or to an index
of precious metals, petroleum, lumber, agricultural prod-
ucts, etc. Commodity and other contracts also include
any other contracts that are not reportable as interest rate,
foreign exchange, equity, or credit derivative contracts.
Line Item M9(e)
Credit exposures.
Report in this item net gains (losses) from trading cash
instruments and derivative contracts that the reporting
holding company manages as credit exposures. Credit
exposures may arise from cash debt instruments (e.g.,
debt securities) and credit derivative contracts. In gen-
eral, credit derivative contracts are arrangements that
allow one party (the ‘‘beneﬁciary’’) to transfer the credit
risk of a ‘‘reference asset’’ or ″reference entity″ to
another party (the ‘‘guarantor’’). Credit derivative con-
tracts include credit default swaps, total return swaps,
credit options, and other credit derivatives.
Memorandum items 9(f) and 9(g) are to be completed by
holding companies with $100 billion or more in total
assets that are required to complete Memorandum items
9(a) through 9(e).

revenue reported in Schedule HI, Memorandum items
9(a) through 9(e), above that resulted from changes
during the calendar year-to-date in the holding com-
pany’s credit valuation adjustments (CVA). A CVA is the
adjustment to the fair value of derivatives that accounts
for possible nonperformance of the holding company’s
derivatives counterparties. It is an estimate of the fair
value of counterparty credit risk.
Line Item M9(g)
Impact on trading revenue of
changes in the creditworthiness of the holding
company on the holding company’s derivative
liabilities (included in Memorandum items 9(a)
through 9(e) above).
Report in this item the amount included in the trading
revenue reported in Schedule HI, Memorandum items
9(a) through 9(e), above that resulted from changes
during the calendar year-to-date in the holding com-
pany’s debit valuation adjustment (DVA). A DVA is the
adjustment to the fair value of derivatives that accounts
for possible nonperformance of the holding company. It
is an estimate of the fair value of the holding company’s
own credit risk to its counterparties.
Memorandum items 10(a) and 10(b) are to be completed
by holding companies with $10 billion or more in total
consolidated assets.
Line Item M10

Income from the sale and
servicing of mutual funds and annuities (in
domestic offices).
Report the amount of income earned by the reporting
holding company during the calendar year-to-date from
the sale and servicing of mutual funds and annuities (in
domestic offices).
Include in this item:
(1) Income earned in connection with mutual funds
and annuities that are sold on the premises of the
reporting holding company or its subsidiaries, or that
are sold by the reporting holding company, a subsid-
iary, or by affiliated or unaffiliated entities from
whom the reporting holding company reports income
on a consolidated basis in the FR Y-9C. This income
may be in the form of fees or sales commissions at
the time of the sale or fees, including a share of
another entity’s fees, that are earned over the dura-
tion of the account (e.g., annual fees, Rule 12b-1 fees
or “trailer fees,” and redemption fees). Commissions
should be reported as income as earned at the time of
the sale (i.e., on an accrual basis), but may be
reported as income when payment is received if the
results would not differ materially from those obtained
using an accrual basis.
(2) Income that is reported on a consolidated basis in the
FR Y-9C from leasing arrangements with affiliated
and unaffiliated entities who lease space in offices
of the reporting holding company or its subsidiaries
for use in selling mutual funds and annuities. Income
from leasing arrangements should be reported as
income as earned (i.e., on an accrual basis), but may
be reported as income when payment is received if
the results would not differ materially from those
obtained using an accrual basis.
(3) Fees for providing investment advisory services for
mutual funds and annuities.
(4) Fees for providing securities custody, transfer agent,
and other operational and ancillary services to mutual
funds and annuities that are sold on the premises of
the reporting holding company, or sold by the report-
ing holding company or its subsidiaries, through a
subsidiary, or by affiliated or unaffiliated entities
from whom the holding company reports income on
a consolidated basis in the FR Y-9C at the time of the
sale or over the duration of the account.
Also include income from sales conducted through the
reporting holding company’s trust department that are
not executed in a ﬁduciary capacity (e.g., trustee, execu-
tor, administrator, conservator) but exclude income from
sales conducted by the trust department that are executed
in a ﬁduciary capacity.
In general, this income will have been included in
Schedule HI, item 5(d)(1), ‘‘Fees and commissions from
securities brokerage’’ (for mutual funds) and item 5(d)(3),
‘‘Fees and commissions from annuity sales.’’ However,
income from leasing arrangements, or the portion thereof,
that is ﬁxed in amount and does not vary based on sales
volume may have been reported as a deduction from
2. This asset size test is determined based on the total assets reported in
the previous year’s June 30 FR Y-9C report.

Equity Capital
Schedule HI-A
General Instructions
Total holding company equity capital includes perpetual
preferred stock, common stock, capital surplus, retained
earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and
other equity capital components such as treasury stock
and unearned Employee Stock Ownership Plan Shares.
All amounts in Schedule HI-A, other than those reported
in items 1, 3, and 12, should represent net aggregate
changes for the calendar year-to-date. Report all net
decreases and losses (net reductions of holding company
equity capital) with a minus (-) sign.
Line Item 1
Total holding company equity capital
most recently reported for the end of previous
calendar year.
Report the consolidated holding company’s total equity
capital balance most recently reported for the previous
calendar year-end after the effect of all corrections and
adjustments to total equity capital that were made in any
amended report(s) for the previous calendar year-end.
Do not enter the consolidated holding company’s total
equity capital ending balance from the Report of Income
for the preceding quarter when preparing the June 30,
September 30, or December 31 report.
For holding companies opened since January 1 of the
current calendar year, report zero in this item. Report the
consolidated holding company’s opening (original) total
equity capital in items 5(a), ‘‘Sale of perpetual preferred
stock, gross’’ or 6(a), ‘‘Sale of common stock, gross’’ as
appropriate.
Pre-opening income earned and expenses incurred from
the holding company’s inception until the date the hold-
ing company commenced operations should be reported
in Schedule HI using one of the two following methods,
consistent with the manner in which the holding com-
pany reports pre-opening income and expenses for other
ﬁnancial reporting purposes:
(1) The net amount of pre-opening income and expenses
for the entire period from the holding company’s
inception until the date the holding company com-
menced operations should be reported in the appro-
priate items of Schedule HI, each quarter during the
calendar year in which operations commenced; or
(2) Pre-opening income and expenses for the period
from the holding company’s inception until the
beginning of the calendar year in which the holding
company commenced operations should be included,
along with the holding company’s opening (original)
equity capital, in this item. The net amount of these
pre-opening income and expenses should be identi-
ﬁed and described in ‘‘Notes to the Income State-
ment.’’ Pre-opening income earned and expenses
incurred during the calendar year in which the hold-
ing company commenced operations should be
reported in the appropriate items of Schedule HI,
each quarter during the calendar year in which
operations commenced.
Line Item 2
Cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles and corrections of material
accounting errors.
Report the sum of the cumulative effect, net of applicable
income taxes, of all changes in accounting principles
adopted during the calendar year-to-date reporting period
that were applied retroactively and for which prior years’
ﬁnancial statements were restated and all corrections
resulting from material accounting errors that were made
in prior years’ Consolidated Financial Statements for
Holding Companies and not corrected by the ﬁling of an
amended report for the period in which the error was
made. Include only those corrections that result from:
(1) Mathematical mistakes.
(2) Mistakes in applying accounting principles.
FR Y-9C

(3) Improper use of information which existed when the
prior Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding
Companies were prepared.
(4) A change from an accounting principle that is neither
accepted nor sanctioned by the Federal Reserve to
one that is acceptable to the Federal Reserve.
The effect of accounting errors differs from the effect of
changes in accounting estimates. Changes in accounting
estimates are an inherent part of the accrual accounting
process. Report the effect of any changes in accounting
estimates in the appropriate line items of Schedule HI,
Consolidated Income Statement. For further information
on corrections of errors and changes in estimates, refer to
the Glossary entry for ‘‘accounting changes.’’
The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
is the difference between (1) the balance in the retained
earnings account at the beginning of the year in which the
change is made and (2) the balance in the retained
earnings account that would have been reported at the
beginning of the year had the newly adopted accounting
principle been applied in all prior periods.

(loss) on the debt security at the date of transfer.
Consistent with ASC Subtopic 320, Investments-
Debt Securities, this unrealized holding gain (loss)
should be amortized over the remaining life of the
debt security as an adjustment of yield.
(4) The portion of other-than-temporary impairment
losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt
securities that was not recognized in earnings in
accordance withASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt
and Equity Securities, subsequent decreases (if not
other-than-temporary impairment losses) or increases
in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities
previously written down as other-than-temporarily
impaired, and subsequent accretion (based on the
amount and timing of future estimated cash ﬂows) of
the portion of other-than-temporary impairment losses
on held-to-maturity debt securities not recognized in
earnings.
(5) The change in the institution’s accumulated net gains
(losses) on derivative instruments that are designated

nized in earnings under a systematic and rational
method when the amortization approach for excluded
components has been elected in accordance with

cost and prior service costs or credits associated with
such plans, which are accounted for in accordance
with ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement
Beneﬁts.
(8) The portion of the total change in the fair value of a
liability resulting from a change in the instrument-
speciﬁc credit risk (“own credit risk”) when the
institution has elected to measure the liability at fair
value in accordance with the fair value option for
ﬁnancial instruments.
(9) The change in the holding company’s cumulative
foreign currency translation adjustments and gains
(losses) on certain foreign currency transactions.
Refer to the Glossary entry for “Foreign Currency

gains (losses) on equity securities with readily determin-
able fair values not held for trading (report in Sched-
ule HI, item 8(b).
For further guidance on reporting other comprehensive
income, see ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income.
Line Item 13
Change in the offsetting debit
to the liability for Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) debt guaranteed by the holding company.
Report an amount in this item only if the consolidated
holding company has guaranteed the debt of its ESOP.
The amount reported in this item should reﬂect any
changes during the calendar year-to-date to the offsetting
debit to the liability recorded by the holding company in
connection with ESOP debt guaranteed by the reporting
company (that is, the equity contra account). The changes
in this account result either: (1) from the booking of an
offsetting debit to any new ESOP debt guaranteed by the
consolidated holding company; or (2) from any reduction
in the equity contra account as existing guaranteed ESOP
debt is amortized.
As the ESOP’s debt is amortized, the equity contra
account is reduced, thereby increasing the total amount
of equity capital reported as outstanding by the reporting
holding company. As the ESOP borrows more funds that
are guaranteed by the reporting holding company, the
offsetting debit increases the equity contra account,
thereby reducing the total amount of equity capital
reported as outstanding.
When the net impact of these changes to the equity contra
account results in an overall decrease to that account, the
amount of that decrease should be reported in this item as
an increase in the total amount of equity capital by
adding that amount when calculating ‘‘changes in equity
capital’’ for this schedule. When the net impact of these
changes to the equity contra account results in an overall
increase to that account, the amount of that increase
should be reported in this item as a decrease in the total
amount of equity capital by placing that amount in
parenthesis and subtracting it when calculating “changes
in equity capital” for this schedule.
Line Item 14
Other adjustments to equity capital
(not included above).
Report in this item all other adjustments to equity capital
that are not properly reported in items 1 through 13.
Included are contributions of capital made to the holding
company when the company is a partnership.
Line Item 15
Total holding company equity capital
end of current period.
Report the sum of items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 14,
less items 8, 10, and 11. This item must equal Schedule
HC, item 27.a, “Total holding company equity capital.”

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Charge-Offs and Recoveries on Loans
and Leases and Changes in Allowances
for Credit Losses
Schedule HI-B
Part I.
Charge-Offs and Recoveries on
Loans and Leases
General Instructions
This part has two columns. In column A report loans and
leases charged off during the current calendar year-to-
date. Also include in column A write-downs to fair value
on loans (and leases) transferred to the held-for-sale
account during the calendar year to date that occurred
when (1) the reporting holding company decided to sell
loans that were not originated or otherwise acquired with
the intent to sell and (2) the fair value of those loans had
declined for any reason other than a change in the general
market level of interest or foreign exchange rates. In
column B report amounts recovered during the current
calendar year-to-date on loans and leases previously
charged off. For those holding companies or consolidated
subsidiaries required to establish and maintain an allo-
cated transfer risk reserve, as speciﬁed in Section 905(a)
of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983, in
the agency regulations implementing the Act (Subpart D
of Federal Reserve Regulation K) and in any guidelines,
or instructions issued by the Federal Reserve, columns A
and B of part I include loans and leases charged off
against and amounts recovered, respectively, through the
allocated transfer risk reserve.
These instructions should be read in conjunction with
the Glossary entries for “domicile” and ”allowances for
credit losses.”
Business Combinations and Transactions between Enti-
ties under Common Control - If the holding company
entered into a business combination that became effective
during the year-to-date reporting period and has been
accounted for under the acquisition method, include the
charge-offs and recoveries of the acquired institution or
other business only after its acquisition. If the reporting
institution was involved in a transaction between entities
under common control that became effective during the
year-to-date reporting period and has been accounted for
in a manner similar to a pooling of interests, report the
charge-offs and recoveries of the combined entities for
the entire calendar year-to-date as though they had
combined at the beginning of the year. For further
information on business combinations and transactions
between entities under common control, see the Glossary
entry for “business combinations.”

This schedule has three columns for information on the
allowances for credit losses, one for each of the following
Schedule HI-B

FR Y-9C
Schedule HI-B
March 2024

asset types: 1) loans and leases held for investment
(Column A), 2) held-to-maturity debt securities (Col-
umn B), and 3) available-for-sale debt securities (Col-
umn C).
Report changes in the allowances for credit losses for
loans and leases held for investment, held-to-maturity
debt securities and available-for-sale debt securities in
the applicable columns.
Report the reconcilement of the allowance for credit
losses on loans and leases on a calendar year-to-date
basis.
For those holding companies required to establish and
maintain an allocated transfer risk reserve as speciﬁed in
Section 905(a) of the International Lending Supervision
Act of 1983, in the agency regulations implementing the
Act (Subpart D of Federal Reserve Regulation K) and in
any guidelines, or instructions issued by the Federal
Reserve, the reconcilement should include the activity in
the allocated transfer risk reserve in column A during the
calendar year-to-date that relates to loans and leases.
Report the provisions for credit losses on off-balance
sheet exposures in Schedule HI-B, Part II, Memorandum
item 7.
Business Combinations, Pushdown Accounting Transac-
tions, and Transactions between Entities under Common
Control—If the reporting holding company entered into a
business combination that became effective during the
year-to-date reporting period and has been accounted for
under the acquisition method, include the recoveries,
charge-offs, and provisions of the acquired institution or
other business only after its acquisition. Under ASC
Topic 805, Business Combinations (formerly FASB
Statement No. 141(R), “Business Combinations”), the
acquired loans and leases must be measured at their
acquisition-date fair values.
However, for a reporting holding company that has
acquired ﬁnancial assets in a business combination that
management has determined to be purchased credit-
deteriorated as of the acquisition date, the holding com-
pany should report the initial allowance gross-up amounts
established upon the purchase of these assets, which are
recorded at the date of acquisition as an addition to the
purchase price to determine the initial amortized cost
basis of the assets, should be reported as positive amounts
in the applicable columns of Schedule HI-B, Part II,
item 6, “Adjustments.”
Similarly, if the reporting holding company was acquired
in a transaction that became effective during the year-to
date reporting period, retained its separate corporate
existence, and elected to apply pushdown accounting in
its separate ﬁnancial statements (including its FR Y-9C
report), include only the recoveries, charge-offs, and
provisions from the date of the holding company’s
acquisition through the end of the year-to-date reporting
period. When applying pushdown accounting, the report-
ing holding company’s loans and leases must be restated
to their acquisition-date fair values, and the holding
company may not carry over its allowances for credit
losses, as applicable, as of the acquisition date. As a
consequence:
• The amounts reported in Schedule HI-B, Part II, item 1,
columns A, B, and C, for the balances of the allow-
ances for credit losses most recently reported for the
end of the previous calendar year must be reported as
negative amounts in Schedule HI-B, Part II, item 6,
columns A, B, and C, “Adjustments.” In addition,
when applying pushdown accounting, for those ﬁnan-
cial assets that management has determined to be
purchased credit-deteriorated as of the holding com-
pany’s acquisition date, the holding company should
report as positive amounts in the applicable columns of
Schedule HI-B, Part II, item 6, “Adjustments,” the
initial allowance gross-up amounts established as of
the acquisition date, which are recorded as an addition
to the acquisition-date fair values of these purchased
credit-deteriorated assets to determine their initial
amortized cost basis.
If the reporting holding company was involved in a
transaction between entities under common control that
became effective during the year-to-date reporting period
and has been accounted for in a manner similar to a
pooling of interests, report the recoveries, charge-offs,
and provisions of the combined entities for the entire
calendar year-to-date as though they had combined at the
beginning of the year. Report the balance as of the end of
the previous calendar year of the allowance for credit
losses of the institution or other business that combined
with the reporting holding company in the common
control transaction in Schedule HI-B, part II, item 6,
columns A, B, or C, “Adjustments.”
For further information on business combinations, push-
down accounting, and transactions between entities under
common control, see the Glossary entry for “business
combinations.”

available-for-sale debt securities, respectively, for recov-
eries during the calendar year to date on amounts previ-
ously charged against the allowance for credit losses. The
amount reported in “Loans and Leases,” column A, of

Line Item 3
LESS: Charge-offs.
Report in columns A, B, and C the amounts of loans and
leases held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securi-
ties, and available-for-sale debt securities charged against
the allowances for credit losses on loans and leases held
for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, and
available-for-sale debt securities, respectively, during the
calendar year-to-date. The amount reported in column A
of this item must equal Schedule HI-B, part I, item 9,
column A, “Total” charge-offs, less Schedule HI-B,
part II, item 4, column A, “LESS: Write-downs arising
from transfers of ﬁnancial assets.”
Line Item 4
LESS: Write-downs arising from
transfers of ﬁnancial assets.
Report in columns A, B, and C the amounts of write-
downs to fair value charged against the allowances for
credit losses on loans and leases held for investment,
held-to-maturity debt securities, and available-for-sale
debt securities, respectively, resulting from transfers of
loans and leases to a held-for-sale account (resulting
from the events described above), or transfers of held-to-
maturity debt securities and available-for-sale debt secu-
rities between held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, and
trading accounts during the calendar year-to-date.
Line Item 5
Provision for credit losses.
Report in columns A, B, and C the amounts expensed as
provisions for credit losses (or reversals of provisions) on
loans and leases held for investment, held-to-maturity
debt securities, and available-for-sale debt securities,
respectively, during the calendar year-to-date. Provisions
for credit losses (or reversals of provisions) on loans and
leases held for investment and held-to-maturity debt
securities represent the amounts necessary to adjust the
related allowances for credit losses at the quarter-end
report date for management’s current estimate of expected
credit losses on these assets. Provisions for credit losses
(or reversals of provisions) on available-for-sale debt
securities represent changes during the calendar year to
date in the amount of impairment related to credit losses
on individual available-for-sale debt securities. The sum
of the amounts reported in item 5, columns A through C,
plus Schedule HI-B, Part II, Memorandum items 5,
“Provisions for credit losses on other ﬁnancial assets
measured at amortized cost,” and 7, “Provisions for
credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures,” must
equal Schedule HI, item 4. If the amount reported in
column A, B, or C for this item is negative, report it with
a minus (-) sign.
Line Item 6
Adjustments.
Report all activity in the allowances for credit losses, as
applicable, that cannot be properly reported in Sched-
ule HI-B, Part II, items 2 through 5, above.
If the reporting holding company was acquired in a
transaction that became effective during the year-to-date
reporting period, retained its separate corporate exis-
tence, and elected to apply pushdown accounting in its
separate ﬁnancial statements; it should report as negative
amounts in columns A, B, and C of this item the balances
of the allowances for credit losses on loans and leases
held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, and
available-for-sale debt securities, respectively, most
recently reported for the end of the previous calendar
year in Schedule HI-B, Part II, item 1, columns A, B,
and C, above. In addition, when applying pushdown
accounting, for those ﬁnancial assets that management
has determined to be purchased credit-deteriorated as of
the institution’s acquisition date, the holding company
should report as positive amounts in columns A, B, and C
of this item, as appropriate, the initial allowance gross-up

a ﬁnancial asset or a pool of ﬁnancial assets if an
institution can support an estimate of expected recoveries
for a pool of unsecured loans, each of which was deemed
uncollectible and fully written off on an individual asset
basis, the institution reduces the allowance for credit
losses by the institution’s estimate of recoveries expected
on a pool basis.

General Instructions for Loans and Leases,
Held for Investment: The loan and lease
portfolio categories for which allowance and
related amortized cost amounts are to be
reported in Schedule HI-C, represent general
categories rather than standardized loan cate-
gories deﬁned in Schedule HC-C, Loans and
Leases. Based on the manner in which it
segments its portfolio for purposes of apply-
ing its allowance methodology, each holding
company should report each component of
the overall allowance reported in Schedule
HC, item 4(c), and the amortized cost in the
related loans and leases in the Schedule HI-C
general loan category that best corresponds
to the characteristics of the related loans and
leases.1
Loans and leases held for investment are
loans and leases that the holding company
has the intent and ability to hold for the
foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff.
For each of the speciﬁed general categories
of loans and leases held for investment, report
in column A, “Amortized Cost”, the amor-
tized cost basis of all loans and leases held
for investment. The sum of the amortized
cost amounts reported in Schedule HI-C,
item 6, column A, “Total” plus the fair value
of loans held for investment reported on
Schedule HC-Q, item 4, column A, for which
the fair value option has been elected must
equal the balance sheet amount of held-for-
investment loans and leases reported in Sched-
ule HC, item 4(b), “Loans and leases held for
investment.”
Thus,
the
amortized
cost
amounts reported in columns A must be net
of unearned income.
For each of the speciﬁed general categories
of loans and leases held for investment, report
in column B, “Allowance Balance,” the
related balance of the allowance for credit
losses measured in accordance with ASC
Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments-
Credit Losses — Measured at Amortized
Cost.

Real estate loans:
1(a)
Construction loans. Report in column A the
amortized cost basis of held-for-investment
construction loans and in column B the
related balance in the allowance for credit
losses for such loans. Exclude loans that the
holding company has elected to report at fair
value under a fair value option.
1. For example, based on its allowance methodology, one holding
company’s allowance components for credit cards might relate to both
consumer and business credit card receivables, but another holding com-
pany’s allowance components for credit cards might relate only to con-
sumer credit card receivables.
As another example, based on its allowance methodology, one holding
company might include its loans secured by farmland in its allowance compo-
nents for commercial real estate loans, but another holding company might.

not reported as real estate loans, credit cards,
or other consumer loans in the other items
reported in Schedule HI-C. Exclude loans
that the holding company has elected to
report at fair value under a fair value option.
3
Credit cards. Report in column A the amor-
tized cost of all held-for-investment exten-
sions of credit arising from credit cards and

Exclude loans that the holding company has
elected to report at fair value under a fair
value option.

Other consumer loans. Report in column A
the amortized cost of all held-for-investment
consumer loans other than credit cards and in

ance for credit losses for such loans. Exclude
loans that the institution has elected to report
at fair value under a fair value option.
5
Unallocated, if any. Report the amount of
any unallocated portion of the allowance for
credit losses on loans and leases. A holding
company should only have an unallocated
portion of its allowance for credit losses that
is appropriately supported and documented,
and such an amount would be acceptable as
part of management’s best estimate of cur-
rent expected credit losses.

Predecessor Financial Items
General Instructions
This one-time reporting schedule is event-driven. An
event for reporting the income statement items below is
deﬁned as a business combination that occurred during
the quarter (that is, the holding company consummated a
merger or acquisition within the quarter). Complete this
schedule only if the combined assets of the acquired
entity(ies) are at least equal to $10 billion or 5 percent of
the reporting holding company’s total consolidated assets
at the previous quarter-end, whichever is less.
Report in accordance with these instructions the selected
income statement information for any acquired compa-
ny(ies), the predecessor, as described above. The infor-
mation should be reported year to date of acquisition, that
is, from January 1 of the current year to the last day prior
to the acquisition date.
Only a single schedule should be completed with aggre-
gated information for all entities acquired during the
quarter. The combined assets of these ﬁrms should at
least equal $10 billion or 5 percent of the respondent’s
total consolidated assets at the previous quarter-end,
whichever is less.
The reporting holding company may report the items
below, net of merger-related adjustments, if any.
In the unlikely event that only a portion of a ﬁrm was
purchased and actual ﬁnancial statements for the acquired
operations are not readily available, the reporting holding
company may provide estimates in lieu of inaccessible
actual data.
If a single transaction business combination occurred
where the acquiree was another holding company that
ﬁled the FR Y-9C in the preceding quarter, and the
combination occurred on the ﬁrst day of the quarter, that
event is exempt from being reported on this schedule.
This exemption also applies if all entities acquired on the

Applicable income taxes.
Report the total estimated federal, state and local, and
foreign income tax expense applicable to item 8, “Income
(loss) before applicable income taxes and discontinued
operations,” including the tax effects of gains (losses) on
securities not held in trading accounts (i.e., held-to-
maturity and available-for-sale securities). Include both
the current and deferred portions of these income taxes. If
the amount is a tax beneﬁt rather than tax expense, report
with a minus (-) sign.

item 8. Report the dollar amount of income taxes appli-
cable to item 8 in this item and report the realized tax
beneﬁts of operating loss carryforwards gross in item 11,
‘‘Discontinued operations, net of applicable income taxes

to the allowance for recoveries on loans and leases
previously charged against the allowance) from January

merger with the acquired entity. Include in charged off
loans and leases write-downs to fair value on loans and
leases transferred to the held-for-sale account during the

reason other than a change in the general market level of
interest or foreign exchange rates.
Line Item 15
Net interest income (item 3 above)
on a fully taxable equivalent basis.
Report net interest income (Notes to the Income State-
ment - Predecessor Financial Items, item 3, “Net interest
income,” above) on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The
amount reported in this item should reﬂect what net
interest income of the acquired company would have
been if all its interest income were subject to federal and
state income taxes.
The following accounts, on which the interest income is
fully or partially tax-exempt, should be adjusted to a
“taxable equivalent” basis in order that the acquired
company’s interest income can be computed on a fully
taxable equivalent basis:
(1) Interest income on tax-exempt obligations (other
than securities) of states and political subdivisions in
the U.S. (included in Notes to the Income Statement -
Predecessor Financial Items, item 1(a), “Interest
income on loans and leases”);
(2) Income on lease ﬁnancing receivables that is tax-
exempt (included in Notes to the Income Statement -
Predecessor Financial Items, item 1(a), “Interest
income on loans and leases”);
(3) Income on tax-exempt securities issued by states and
political subdivisions in the U.S. (included in Notes
to the Income Statement - Predecessor Financial
Items, item 1(b), “Interest income on investment
securities”); and
(4) Any other interest income (such as interest income
earned on loans to an Employee Stock Ownership
Plan), which under state or federal laws is partially or
in its entirety exempt from income taxes.
The changes to the 1986 Tax Reform Act must be taken
into consideration when computing net interest income
on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The 1986 Act, in
general, disallowed 100% of the interest expense allo-
cable to tax-exempt obligations acquired after August 7,
1986. Previous to that date, and after December 31, 1982,
the disallowance percentage was 20%; previous to Decem-
ber 31, 1982, the disallowance was 0%.

Line Item 1
Cash and balances due from
depository institutions.
Report in item 1(a) noninterest-bearing balances due
from depository institutions and currency and coin and in
item 1(b) interest-bearing balances due from depository
institutions.
Depository institutions cover the following
(1) Depository institutions in the U.S., i.e.,
(a) U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks
(refer to the Glossary entry for ‘‘Banks, U.S. and
Foreign’’ for the deﬁnition of this term);
(b) U.S. branches of U.S. banks (refer to the Glossary
entry for ‘‘Banks, U.S. and Foreign’’);
(c) savings or building and loan associations, home-
stead associations, and cooperative banks;
(d) mutual and stock savings banks; and
(e) credit unions.
(2) Banks in foreign countries, i.e.,
(a) foreign-domiciled branches of other U.S. banks;
and
(b) foreign-domiciled branches of foreign banks.
See the Glossary entry for ‘‘Banks, U.S. and For-
eign’’ for a description of banks in foreign countries.
(3) Foreign central banks, i.e.,
(a) foreign central banks in foreign countries;
(b) departments of foreign central governments that
have, as an important part of their functions,
activities similar to those of a central bank;
(c) nationalized banks and banking institutions owned
by central governments that have, as an impor-
tant part of their functions, activities similar to
those of a central bank; and
(d) the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
Balances due from such institutions cover all interest-
bearing and noninterest-bearing balances whether in the
form of demand, savings, or time balances, including
certiﬁcates of deposit, but excluding any balances held
in the consolidated holding company’s trading accounts.
Balances with foreign central banks should include all
balances with such entities, including reserve, operating,
and investment balances. Balances should include ‘‘place-
ments and redeposits’’ between foreign offices of the
banking subsidiaries of the reporting holding company
and foreign offices of other banks.
Treatment of reciprocal balances with depository institu-
tions. Reciprocal balances arise when two depository
institutions maintain balances with each other, i.e., each
institution has both a ‘‘due from’’ and a ‘‘due to’’ balance
with the other institution. For purposes of reporting on
this schedule and on Schedule HC-E, Deposit Liabilities,
reciprocal balances should be reported in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
For purposes of these reports, deposit accounts ‘‘due
from’’ other depository institutions that are overdrawn
are to be reported as borrowings in Schedule HC, item 16.
For further information, refer to the Glossary entry for
‘‘Overdraft.’’

other depository institutions that are not consolidated on
the reporting holding company’s FR Y-9C (i.e., its ‘‘due
from’’ accounts) are to be reported as borrowings in
Schedule HC, item 16, except overdrafts arising in
connection with checks or drafts drawn by subsidiary
depository institutions of the reporting holding company
and drawn on, or payable at or through, another deposi-
tory institution either on a zero-balance account or on an
account that is not routinely maintained with sufficient
balances to cover checks or drafts drawn in the normal
course of business during the period until the amount of

institution (in which case, report the funds received or
held in connection with such checks or drafts as deposits
in Schedule HC-E until the funds are remitted).

other institutions that have already been for-
warded for collection but for which the reporting
bank has not yet been given credit (‘‘cash let-
ters’’) and checks or drafts on hand that will be
presented for payment or forwarded for collec-
tion on the following business day.
(b) Government checks drawn on the Treasurer of
the United States or any other government agency
that are payable immediately upon presentation
and that are in process of collection.
(c) Such other items in process of collection that are
payable immediately upon presentation and that
are customarily cleared or collected as cash items
by depository institutions in the country where
the reporting holding company’s office which is
clearing or collecting the item is located.
(2) Unposted debits, which are cash items in a subsidiary
depository institution’s possession, drawn on itself,
that are immediately chargeable, but that have not
been charged to the general ledger deposit control
account at the close of business on the report date.
(3) Noninterest-bearing balances with depository institu-
tions, i.e., whether in the form of demand, time, or
savings balances, provided that the accounts pay no
interest.
(4) Currency and coin. Include both U.S. and foreign
currency and coin owned and held in all offices of the
consolidated holding company; currency and coin in
transit to a Federal Reserve Bank or to any other

(3) Commodity or bill-of-lading drafts (including arrival
drafts) not yet payable (because the merchandise
against which the draft was drawn has not yet
arrived), whether or not deposit credit has been
given. (If deposit credit has been given, report as
loans in the appropriate item of Schedule HC-C; if
the drafts were received on a collection basis, they
should be excluded entirely from the consolidated
holding company’s balance sheet, Schedule HC, until
the funds have actually been collected.)

banks and central banks wherever those institutions are
located, provided that such balances are booked as assets
in domestic offices of the holding company or of its
consolidated subsidiaries.
Exclude balances held in Edge and Agreement subsidi-
aries or in international banking facilities (IBFs) of the
reporting holding company, which are considered foreign
offices of the holding company for purposes of this

Report the fair value of all investments in mutual funds
and other equity securities (as deﬁned in ASC Topic 321,

fair values that are not held for trading. Such securities
include, but are not limited to, money market mutual
funds, mutual funds that invest solely in U.S. Govern-
ment securities, common stock, and perpetual preferred
stock. Perpetual preferred stock does not have a stated
maturity date and cannot be redeemed at the option of the
investor, although it may be redeemable at the option of
the issuer.
The fair value of equity securities with readily determin-
able fair values not held for trading included in this item
2.c that are pledged should be reported in Schedule
HC-B, Memorandum item 1, “Pledged securities.”
Exclude equity securities held for trading from Schedule
HC, item 2(c). For purposes of the FR Y-9C balance
sheet, trading activities typically include (a) regularly
underwriting or dealing in securities; interest rate, for-
eign exchange rate, commodity, equity, and credit deriva-
tive contracts; other ﬁnancial investments; and other
assets for resale, (b) acquiring or taking positions in such
items principally for the purpose of selling in the near
term or otherwise with the intent to resell in order to
proﬁt from short-term price movements, and (c) acquir-
ing or taking positions in such items as an accommoda-
tion to customers, provided that acquiring or taking such
positions meets the deﬁnition of ″trading″ in ASC Topic
320, Investments-Debt Securities, and ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging, and the deﬁnition of ″trading
purposes″ in ASC Topic 815. When a holding company’s
holdings of equity securities with readily determinable
fair values falls within the scope of the preceding descrip-
tion of trading activities, the equity securities should be
reported as trading assets in Schedule HC, item 5.
Otherwise, the equity securities should be reported in this
item 2(c).
According to ASC Topic 321, the fair value of an equity
security is readily determinable if sales prices or bid-and-
asked quotations are currently available on a securities
exchange registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) or in the over-the-counter market,
provided that those prices or quotations for the over-the-
counter market are publicly reported by the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations
systems or by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“Restricted
stock” meets that deﬁnition if the restriction terminates
within one year.) The fair value of an equity security
traded only in a foreign market is readily determinable if
that foreign market is of a breadth and scope comparable
to one of the U.S. markets referred to above. The fair
value of an investment in a mutual fund (or in a structure
similar to a mutual fund, i.e., a limited partnership or a
venture capital entity) is readily determinable if the fair
value per share (unit) is determined and published and is
the basis for current transactions.
Investments in mutual funds and other equity securities
with readily determinable fair values may have been
purchased by the reporting holding company or acquired
for debts previously contracted.
The fair value of pledged equity securities with readily
determinable fair values not held for trading reported in
Schedule HC, item 2.c should be included in the amount
reported in Schedule HC-B, Memorandum item 1.
Include in this item common stock and perpetual pre-
ferred stock of the Federal National Mortgage Associa-

Corporation (Freddie Mac), Class A voting and Class C
non-voting common stock of the Federal Agricultural
Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), and common and
preferred stock of SLM Corporation (the private-sector
successor to the Student Loan Marketing Association).
The fair value of pledged equity securities with readily
determinable fair values not held for trading reported in
Schedule HC, item 2.c should be included in the amount

(4) Preferred stock that by its terms either must be
redeemed by the issuing enterprise or is redeemable

(5) “Restricted stock,” i.e., equity securities for which
sale is restricted by governmental or contractual
requirement (other than in connection with being
pledged as collateral), except if that requirement
terminates within one year or if the holder has the

ment to be met within one year (if the restriction does
not terminate within one year, report “restricted
stock” as an equity investment without a readily
determinable fair value in Schedule HC-F, item 4).
(6) Participation certiﬁcates issued by a Federal Interme-
diate Credit Bank, which represent nonvoting stock
in the bank (report as an equity investment without a

any companies not meeting the deﬁnition of associ-
ated company (report as equity investments without
readily determinable fair values in Schedule HC-F,

represent bank premises (report in Schedule HC,
item 6) or other real estate owned (report in Schedule
HC, item 7), provided that the fair value of any
capital stock representing the minority interest is not
readily determinable. (See the Glossary entry for
“Subsidiaries” for the deﬁnition of associated com-
pany.)
(8) Equity holdings in those corporate joint ventures
over which the reporting institution does not exercise
signiﬁcant inﬂuence (report as equity investments
without readily determinable fair value in Schedule

Federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreements to resell.
Line Item 3(a)
Federal funds sold in domestic
offices.
Report the outstanding amount of federal funds sold,
i.e., immediately available funds lent (in domestic offices)
under agreements or contracts that have an original
maturity of one business day or roll over under a
continuing contract, excluding such funds lent in the
form of securities purchased under agreements to resell
(which should be reported in Schedule HC, item 3(b))
and overnight lending for commercial and industrial
purposes (which generally should be reported in Sched-
ule HC, item 4(b)). Transactions that are to be reported as
federal funds sold may be secured or unsecured or may
involve an agreement to resell loans or other instruments
that are not securities.
Immediately available funds are funds that the purchas-
ing holding company can either use or dispose of on the
same business day that the transaction giving rise to the
receipt or disposal of the funds is executed. A continuing
contract, regardless of the terminology used, is an agree-
ment that remains in effect for more than one business
day, but has no speciﬁed maturity and does not require
advance notice of the lender or the borrower to terminate.
Report federal funds sold on a gross basis, i.e., do not net
them against federal funds purchased, except to the
extent permitted under ASC Subtopic 210-20, Balance

Line Item 5
Trading assets.
Trading activities typically include (a) regularly under-
writing or dealing in securities; interest rate, foreign
exchange rate, commodity, equity, and credit derivative
contracts; other ﬁnancial instruments; and other assets for
resale; (b) acquiring or taking positions in such items
principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or
otherwise with the intent to resell in order to proﬁt from
short-term price movements; or (c) acquiring or taking
positions in such items as an accommodation to custom-
ers, provided that acquiring or taking such positions
meets the deﬁnition of ″trading″ in ASC Topic 320,
Investments-Debt Securities, and ASC Topic 815, Deriva-
tives and Hedging, and the deﬁnition of ″trading pur-
poses″ in ASC Topic 815. Assets and other ﬁnancial
instruments held for trading shall be consistently valued
at fair value as deﬁned by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value
Measurement.
For purposes of the FR Y-9C report, all debt securities
within the scope of ASC Topic 320, Investment-Debt
Securities that a holding company has elected to report at
fair value under a fair value option with changes in fair
value reported in current earnings should be classiﬁed as
trading securities. In addition, for purposes of this report,
holding companies may classify assets (other than debt
securities within the scope of ASC Topic 320 for which a
fair value option is elected) as trading if the holding
company applies fair value accounting, with changes in
fair value reported in current earnings, and manages
these assets as trading positions, subject to the controls
and applicable regulatory guidance related to trading
activities. For example, a holding company would gener-
ally not classify a loan to which it has applied the fair
value option as a trading asset unless the holding com-
pany holds the loan, which it manages as a trading
position, for one of the following purposes: (1) for
market making activities, including such activities as
accumulating loans for sale or securitization; (2) to
beneﬁt from actual or expected price movements; or (3)
to lock in arbitrage proﬁts.
Do not include in this item the carrying value of any
available-for-sale securities, any loans that are held for
sale (and are not classiﬁed as trading in accordance with
the preceding instruction), and any leases that are held for
sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported in
Schedule HC, item 2(b), and in Schedule HC-B, columns
C and D. Loans (not classiﬁed as trading) and leases held
for sale should be reported in Schedule HC, item 4(a),
“Loans and leases held for sale,” and in Schedule HC-C.
Trading assets also include derivatives with a positive
fair value resulting from the “marking to market” of
interest rate, foreign exchange rate, commodity, equity,
and credit derivative contracts held for trading purposes
as of the report date. Derivative contracts with the same
counterparty that have positive fair values and negative
fair values and meet the criteria for a valid right of setoff
contained in ASC Subtopic 210-20, Balance Sheet –
Offsetting (e.g., those contracts subject to a qualifying
master netting agreement) may be reported on a net basis
using this item and Schedule HC, item 15, “Trading
liabilities,” as appropriate. (See the Glossary entry for
“Offsetting.”)

lated depreciation or amortization and any impairment
losses, of all premises, equipment, furniture, and ﬁxtures.
Also, report right-of-use (ROU) asset accounted for in
accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Any method of
depreciation or amortization should conform to generally
accepted accounting principles.
Do not deduct mortgages or other liens on such property
(report in Schedule HC, item 16, ‘‘Other borrowed
money’’).
Include the following as premises and ﬁxed assets
(1) Premises that are actually owned and occupied (or to
be occupied, if under construction) by the holding
company, its consolidated subsidiaries, or their
branches.
(2) Leasehold improvements, vaults, and ﬁxed machin-
ery and equipment.
(3) Capitalized remodeling costs to existing premises.
(4) Real estate acquired and intended to be used for
future expansion.
(5) Parking lots that are used by customers or employees
of the holding company, its consolidated subsidi-
aries, and their branches.
(6) Furniture, ﬁxtures, and movable equipment of the
holding company, its consolidated subsidiaries, and
their branches.
(7) Automobiles, airplanes, and other vehicles owned by
the holding company or its consolidated subsidiaries
and used in the conduct of its business.
(8) The amount of capital lease property, and for a lessee
institution that has adopted ASC Topic 842, the
amount of ROU assets that represents premises,
equipment, furniture, and ﬁxtures.
In general, under ASC Topic 842 for an institution as
lessee, the ROU asset for a ﬁnance lease should be
reported at cost less any accumulated amortization
and any accumulated impairment losses; the ROU
asset for an operating lease (not previously impaired)
should be reported at the book value of the related
lease liability adjusted for the remaining balance of
any lease incentives received, any prepaid or accrued
lease payments, any unamortized initial direct costs,
and any current period impairment. After an ROU
asset for an operating lease is impaired, it should be
reported at its carrying amount immediately after the
impairment less any accumulated amortization. See
the discussion of accounting by an institution as
lessee in the Glossary entry for “Lease Accounting.”
(9) (a) Stocks and bonds issued by nonmajority-owned
corporations and
(b) Investments in limited partnerships or limited
liability companies (other than investments so
minor that the institution has virtually no inﬂu-
ence over the partnership or company) whose
principal activity is the ownership of land, build-
ings, equipment, furniture, or ﬁxtures occupied
or used (or to be occupied or used) by the
holding company or its consolidated subsidi-
aries. Report such stocks and investments at
(i) fair value or (ii) if chosen by the reporting
holding company for an equity investment that
does not have a readily determinable fair value,
at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes
in orderly transactions for the identical or a
similar investment of the same issuer.
Property formerly but no longer used for banking or
nonbanking activities may be reported in this item as
‘‘Premises and ﬁxed assets’’ or in item 7, ‘‘Other real
estate owned.’’
Exclude from premises and ﬁxed assets
(1) Original paintings, antiques, and similar valuable
objects (report in item 11, ‘‘Other assets’’);
(2) Favorable leasehold rights (report in Schedule HC-M
item 12(c) “All other identiﬁable intangible assets”);
and
(3) Loans and advances, whether secured or unsecured,
to individuals, partnerships, and nonmajority-owned
corporations for the purpose of purchasing or holding
land, buildings, or ﬁxtures occupied or used (or to be
occupied or used) by the holding company, its con-
solidated subsidiaries, or their branches (report in
item 4(b) ‘‘Loans and leases, held for investment’’).

Line Item 8
Investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries and associated companies.
Report the amount of the holding company’s investments
in the stock of all subsidiaries that have not been
consolidated, associated companies, corporate joint ven-
tures, unincorporated joint ventures, and general partner-
ships over which the holding company exercises signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence; and noncontrolling investments in certain
limited partnerships and limited liability companies
(described in the Glossary entry for ‘‘Equity Method of
Accounting’’), excluding those that represent direct and
indirect investments in real estate venture (which are to
be reported in Schedule HC, item 9). The entities in
which these investments have been made are collectively
referred to as ‘‘investees.’’ Special purpose entities issu-
ing trust preferred securities that a holding company
deconsolidates under GAAP generally are considered
unconsolidated subsidiaries for regulatory reporting and
other regulatory purposes. Include such investments in
unconsolidated special purpose entities that issue trust
preferred securities. Also include loans and advances to
investees and holdings of their bonds, notes, and deben-
tures.
Investments in the common stock of investees shall be
reported using the equity method of accounting in accor-
dance with GAAP. Under the equity method, the carrying
value of the holding company’s investment in the com-
mon stock of an investee is originally recorded at cost but
is adjusted periodically to record as income the holding
company’s proportionate share of the investee’s earnings
or losses and decreased by the amount of any cash
dividends received from the investee and amortization of
goodwill.
For purposes of this report, the date through which the
carrying value of the holding company’s investment in an
investee has been adjusted should, to the extent practi-
cable, match the report date of the FR Y-9C, but in no
case differ by more than 93 days from the report date.
Unconsolidated subsidiaries include all subsidiaries of
the reporting holding company that are 50 percent or less
owned (i.e., less than majority-owned) by the reporting
holding company or, for some reason under GAAP, are
not consolidated on the reporting holding company’s
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Refer to the General
Instructions section of this book for a more detailed
discussion of consolidation. See also the Glossary entry
for ‘‘Subsidiaries’’ for deﬁnitions of subsidiary, associ-
ated companies, and joint ventures.

real estate ventures.
Report the amount of the holding company’s direct and
indirect investments in real estate ventures.
Exclude real estate acquired in any manner for debts
previously contracted, including, but not limited to, real
estate acquired through foreclosure or acquired by deed
in lieu of foreclosure, and equity holdings that indirectly
represent such real estate (report in Schedule HC-M, item
13, ‘‘Other real estate owned’’). Include as direct and
indirect investments in real estate ventures:
(1) Any real estate acquired, directly or indirectly, by the
holding company or a consolidated subsidiary and
held for development, resale, or other investment
purposes. (Do not include real estate acquired in any
manner for debts previously contracted, including,
but not limited to, real estate acquired through fore-
closure or acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure.
Report such real estate in Schedule HC-M, item 13.)
(2) Real estate acquisition, development, or construction
(ADC) arrangements which are accounted for as
direct investments in real estate or real estate joint
ventures in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-10,
Receivables – Overall (formerly AICPA Practice
Bulletin 1, Appendix, Exhibit I, ADC Arrangements).
(3) Real estate originally acquired and held for invest-
ment by the holding company or a consolidated
subsidiary that has been sold under contract and the
sale does not meet sale accounting treatment in
accordance
with
ASC
Subtopic
610-20
and
ASC Topic 606.
(4) Any other loans secured by real estate and advanced
for real estate acquisition, development, or invest-
ment purposes if the reporting holding company in
substance has virtually the same risks and potential
rewards as an investor in the borrower’s real estate
venture.

ments in certain limited partnerships and limited

for ‘‘Equity Method of Accounting’’) that are primar-
ily engaged in the holding of real estate for develop-
ment, resale, or other investment purposes. The
entities in which these investments have been made
are collectively referred to as ‘‘investees.’’ Invest-
ments by the holding company in these investees
may be in the form of common or preferred stock,
partnership interests, loans or other advances, bonds,
notes, or debentures. Such investments shall be
reported using the equity method of accounting. For
further information on the equity method, see the
instruction to Schedule HC, item 8, above.
(6) Investments in corporate joint ventures, unincorpo-
rated joint ventures, and general partnerships over
which the holding company does not exercise signiﬁ-

minor that the holding company has virtually no
inﬂuence over the partnership or company, where the
entity in which the investment has been made is
primarily engaged in the holding of real estate for
development, resale, or other investment purposes.
Report such investments at (i) fair value or (ii) if
chosen by the reporting holding company for an

an original maturity of one business day or roll over under
a continuing contract, excluding such funds borrowed in
the form of securities sold under agreements to repurchase
(which should be reported in Schedule HC, item 14(b))
and Federal Home Loan Bank advances (which should be
reported in Schedule HC, item 16). Transactions that are
to be reported as federal funds purchased may be secured
or unsecured or may involve an agreement to repurchase
loans or other instruments that are not securities.
Immediately available funds are funds that the purchas-
ing institution can either use or dispose of on the same
business day that the transaction giving rise to the receipt
or disposal of the funds is executed. A continuing
contract, regardless of the terminology used, is an agree-
ment that remains in effect for more than one business
day, but has no speciﬁed maturity and does not require
advance notice of the lender or the borrower to terminate.
Report federal funds purchased on a gross basis, i.e., do
not net them against federal funds sold, except to the

Trading liabilities.
Report the amount of liabilities from the reporting hold-
ing company’s trading activities. Trading liabilities shall
be consistently valued at fair value as deﬁned by ASC

Adjustments of accruals and other accounting estimates
made shortly after the report date that relate to the
income and expenses of the year-to-date period ended as
of the report date must be reported in the appropriate
items of Schedule HI, Income Statement, for that year-to-
date period.
Capital reserves are segregations of retained earnings and
are not to be reported as liability accounts or as reduc-
tions of asset balances. Capital reserves may be estab-
lished for such purposes as follows:
(1) Reserve for undeclared stock dividends—includes
amounts set aside to provide for stock dividends (not
cash dividends) not yet declared.
(2) Reserve for undeclared cash dividends—includes
amounts set aside for cash dividends on common and
preferred stock not yet declared. (Cash dividends
declared but not yet payable should be included in
item 20, ‘‘Other liabilities,’’ of this schedule.)
(3) Retirement account (for limited-life preferred stock
or notes and debentures subordinated to deposits)—
includes amounts allocated under the plan for retire-
ment of limited-life preferred stock or notes and
debentures subordinated to deposits contained in the
holding company’s articles of association or in the
agreement under which such stock or notes and
debentures were issued.
(4) Reserve for contingencies includes amounts set aside
for possible unforeseen or indeterminate liabilities
not otherwise reﬂected on the holding company’s
books and not covered by insurance. This reserve
may include, for example, reserves set up to provide
for possible losses that holding company may sustain
because of lawsuits, the deductible amount under the
holding company’s blanket bond, defaults on obliga-
tions for which the holding company is contingently
liable, or other claims against the holding company.
A reserve for contingencies represents a segregation
of retained earnings. It should not include any ele-
ment of known losses or of any probable losses the
amount of which can be estimated with reasonable
accuracy (see the Glossary entry for ‘‘Loss Contin-
gencies’’ for additional information).
Exclude the following from retained earnings:
(1) The amount of the cumulative foreign currency trans-
lation adjustment (report in item 26(b)).
(2) Any portion of the proceeds received from the sale of
perpetual preferred stock and common stock in
excess of its par or stated value (report surplus
related to perpetual preferred stock in item 23 and
surplus related to common stock in item 25 except
where required by state law or regulation).
(3) Any portion of the proceeds received from the sale of
limited-life preferred stock in excess of its par or
stated value (report in Schedule HC, item 19(a)).

such as valuation allowances (e.g., the allowances for
credit losses), reserves for depreciation, and reserves
for bond premiums.
Line Item 26(b)
Accumulated other comprehensive
income.
Report the accumulated balance of other comprehensive
income as of the report date in accordance with ASC
Subtopic 220-10, Comprehensive Income — Overall, net
of applicable income taxes, if any. “Other comprehensive
income” refers to revenues, expenses, gains, and losses
that under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
are included in comprehensive income but excluded from
net income.
Items of accumulated other comprehensive income
include:
(1) Net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-
for-sale debt securities (including debt securities
transferred into the available-for-sale category from
the held-to-maturity category), i.e., the difference
between the amortized cost and the fair value of the
reporting holding company’s available-for-sale debt
securities (excluding any available-for-sale debt secu-
rities
previously
written
down
as
other-than-
temporarily impaired or any allowances for credit
losses, excluding the portion of the difference consist-
ing of an allowance for credit losses, if any).1 For
most institutions, all ‘‘debt securities,’’ as that term is
deﬁned in ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt Securi-
ties that are designated as “available-for-sale” will be
reported as “Available-for-sale debt securities” in
Schedule HC, item 2.b, and in Schedule HC, columns
C and D. However, an institution may have certain
assets that fall within the deﬁnition of “debt securi-
ties” in ASC Topic 320 (e.g., nonrated industrial
development obligations) that it has designated as
“available-for-sale” and reports in a balance sheet
category other than “Securities” (e.g., “Loans and
lease ﬁnancing receivables”) for purposes of the
Report of Condition. These “available-for-sale” assets
must be carried on the Holding company’s balance
sheet at fair value rather than amortized cost and the
difference between these two amounts, net of tax
effects, also must be included in this item.
(2) The unamortized balance of the unrealized holding
gain (loss) that existed at the date of transfer of a debt
security transferred into the held-to-maturity cate-
gory from the available-for-sale category. Consistent
with ASC Topic 320, when a debt security is trans-
ferred from the available-for-sale category into the
held-to-maturity category, the (unrealized holding
gain (loss) at the date of transfer continues to be
reported in the accumulated other comprehensive
income account, but must be amortized over the
remaining life of the security as an adjustment of
yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of
any premium or discount.
(3) The unaccreted portion of unrealized losses on
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securi-
ties that was not recognized in earnings in accor-
dance with ASC Topic 320, plus the accumulated
amount of subsequent increases or decreases (not
attributable to credit impairment) in the fair value of
available-for sale debt securities, or increases in the
fair value after a write-down that resulted from the
intent to sell or a more likely-than-not requirement
to sell.
(4) Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income
related to derivative instruments that are designated
and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges,2 in accordance with
1. For example, if the fair value of the reporting institution’s available-
for-sale debt securities exceeds the amortized cost of its available-for-sale
debt securities by $100,000 (and the institution has had no other transac-
tions affecting the “net unrealized holding gains (losses)” account), the
amount to be included in Schedule HC, item 26.b, must be reduced by the
estimated amount of taxes using the institution’s applicable tax rate (fed-
eral, state and local). (See the Glossary entry for “Income Taxes” for a
discussion of ‘‘applicable tax rate.’’) If the institution’s applicable tax rate
(federal, state and local) is 25 percent and the tax basis of its available-for-
sale debt securities approximates their amortized cost, the institution
would include ‘‘net unrealized holding gains’’ of $75,000 in Schedule HC,
item 26.b. The institution would also have a deferred tax liability of
$25,000 that would enter into the determination of the amount of net
deferred tax assets or liabilities to be reported in Schedule HC, item 2, or
Schedule HC-G, item 2.
2. Generally, the objective of a cash ﬂow hedge is to link a derivative to
an existing recognized asset or liability or a forecasted transaction with
exposure to variability in expected future cash ﬂows, e.g., the future
interest payments (receipts) on a variable-rate liability (asset) or a fore-
casted purchase (sale). The changes in cash ﬂows of the derivative are
expected to offset changes in cash ﬂows of the hedged item or transaction.
To achieve the matching of cash ﬂows, ASC Topic 815 requires that the
effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and
qualifying as cash ﬂow hedges initially be reported in the accumulated
other comprehensive income component of equity capital and subse-
quently be reclassiﬁed into earnings in the same future period or periods
that the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Schedule HC
HC-14
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC
March 2024

ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. See also
the Glossary entry for “Derivative Contracts.”
The balance in accumulated other comprehensive income
associated with each transaction hedged in a cash ﬂow
hedge should be the cumulative gain (loss) on the
derivative instrument from inception of the hedge, less
all of the following:
(a) The derivative’s gains (losses) previously reclas-
siﬁed from accumulated other comprehensive
income into earnings to offset the hedged transac-
tion;
(b) The cumulative amount amortized to earnings
related to components excluded from assess-
ments of effectiveness that are accounted for
through an amortization approach when this treat-
ment of excluded components has been elected in
accordance with ASC Topic 815; and
(c) The cumulative change in fair value of an
excluded component for which changes in fair
value are recorded currently in earnings when
this treatment of excluded components has been
elected in accordance with ASC Topic 815.
Accordingly, the amount reported in this item 26.b by a
holding company should reﬂect the sum of the cumula-
tive gain (loss) less the speciﬁed amounts described
above for each derivative designated and qualifying as a
cash ﬂow hedge. Amounts in accumulated other compre-
hensive income related to the derivative designated as a
hedging instrument included in the assessment of hedge
effectiveness should be reclassiﬁed to earnings in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transac-
tion affects earnings (for example, when a hedged
variable-rate interest receipt on a loan is accrued or when
a forecasted sale occurs) and presented in the same
income statement item in Schedule HI as the earnings
effect of the hedged item. In addition, amounts in accu-
mulated other comprehensive income related to compo-
nents excluded from assessments of effectiveness that are
recognized in earnings through an amortization approach
should be presented in the same income statement item in
Schedule HI as the earnings effect of the hedged item.
Those instruments which are designated and qualify as
cash ﬂow hedges should have the entire change in value
of the derivative included in the assessment of effective-
ness presented within this item other than amounts
reclassiﬁed on the income statement as described in
Schedule HI-A, item 12.
For all types of hedges, if certain portions of a hedging
instrument’s change in fair value are excluded from
assessments of hedge effectiveness, the cumulative change
in fair value of the excluded components from inception
of the hedges less the cumulative amounts amortized to
earnings related to the excluded components that are
accounted for through an amortization approach when
this treatment of excluded components has been elected
in accordance with ASC Topic 815.
(5) Foreign currency translation adjustments and gains
(losses) on certain foreign currency transactions
accumulated in accordance with ASC Topic 830,
Foreign Currency Matters. See the Glossary entry for
‘‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation’’
for further information.
(6) The accumulated amounts of gains (losses), transi-
tion assets or obligations, and prior service costs or
credits associated with single-employer deﬁned bene-
ﬁt pension and other postretirement plans that have
not yet been recognized as components of net peri-
odic beneﬁt cost in accordance with ASC Topic 715,
Compensation-Retirement Beneﬁts.
(7) The accumulated amount of net gains (losses) result-
ing from changes in fair value attributable to
instrument-speciﬁc credit risk (“own credit risk”) of
liabilities for which the fair value option for ﬁnancial
instruments has been elected.

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Securities
Schedule HC-B
General Instructions
This schedule has four columns for information on
securities: two columns for held-to-maturity securities
and two columns for available-for-sale securities.1 Report
the amortized cost and fair value of held-to-maturity
securities in columns A and B, respectively. Report the
amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt
securities in columns C and D, respectively. Investments
in equity securities, including investment in mutual funds
with readily determinable fair values not held for trading
are no longer reported in HC-B. Institutions should report
the fair value of their holdings of equity securities with
readily determinable fair values not held for trading in
Schedule HC, item 2.c.
Report the amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities
and available-for-sale debt securities in columns A and C,
respectively, without any deduction for allowances for
credit losses on such securities.
Exclude from this schedule all securities held for trading
and debt securities the holding company has elected to
report at fair value under a fair value option even if
holding company management did not acquire the secu-
rities principally for the purpose of selling them in the
near term. Securities held for trading and debt securities
reported under a fair value option are to be reported in
Schedule HC, item 5, “Trading assets,” and, for certain
holding companies, in Schedule HC-D - Trading Assets
and Liabilities. Trading assets and debt securities reported
under a fair value option are also reported in Schedule
HC-Q - Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair
Value.
In general, amortized cost is the purchase price of a debt
security adjusted for amortization of premium or accre-
tion of discount if the debt security was purchased at
other than par or face value. (See the Glossary entry for
“premiums and discounts.”) As deﬁned in ASC Topic
820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, fair
value is “the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date.”
For further information, see the Glossary entry for “fair
value.”
The preferred method for reporting purchases and sales
of securities is as of trade date. However, settlement date
accounting is acceptable if the reported amounts would
not be materially different. (See the Glossary entry for
“trade date and settlement date accounting.”)
For purposes of this schedule, the following events and
transactions shall be treated in the following manner:
(1) Purchases of securities under agreements to resell
and
sales
of
securities
under
agreements
to
repurchase—These transactions are not to be treated
as purchases or sales of securities but as lending
or borrowing (i.e., ﬁnancing) transactions collateral-
ized by these securities if the agreements meet the
criteria for a borrowing as set forth in ASC Topic
860, Transfers and Servicings. For further informa-
tion, see the Glossary entry for “transfers of ﬁnancial
assets” and “repurchase/resale agreements.”
(2) Purchases and sales of participations in pools of
securities—Similarly, these transactions are not to be
treated as purchases or sales of the securities in the
pool but as lending or borrowing (i.e., ﬁnancing)
transactions collateralized by the pooled securities if
the participation agreements meet the criteria for a
1. Available-for-sale debt securities are generally reported in Schedule
HC-B, columns C and D. However, a holding company may have certain
assets that fall within the deﬁnition of ‘‘debt securities” in ASC Topic 320,
Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, (e.g., certain industrial develop-
ment obligations) that the holding company has designated as “available-
for-sale” which are reported for purposes of the FR Y-9C report in a
balance sheet category other than “Securities” (e.g., “Loans and lease
ﬁnancing receivables”).

ﬁnancial assets” and “repurchase/resale agreements.”
(3) Pledged securities—Pledge held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale debt securities that have not been
transferred to the secured party should continue to be
included in the pledging holding company’s holdings
of securities that are reported in Schedule HC-B. If
the reporting holding company has transferred
pledged securities to the secured party, the reporting
holding company should account for the pledged
securities in accordance with ASC Topic 860.
(4) Securities borrowed and lent—Securities borrowed
and lent shall be reported on the balance sheet
of either the borrowing or lending holding company
or its consolidated subsidiaries in accordance with
ASC Topic 860. For further information, see the
Glossary entries for “transfers of ﬁnancial assets”
and “securities borrowing/lending transactions.
(5) Short sales of securities—Such transactions are to be
reported as described in the Glossary entry for ‘‘short

(6) Futures, forward, and standby contracts—Such open
contracts to buy or sell in the future are to be reported
as derivatives in Schedule HC-L, item 11).

Report in the appropriate columns the amortized cost and
fair value of all obligations of U.S. Government agencies
and U.S. Government-sponsored agencies (excluding
mortgage-backed securities) not held for trading.
Distinction between U.S. Government Agencies and U.S.
Government-sponsored Agencies — For purposes of
these reports, a U.S. Government agency is deﬁned as an
instrumentality of the U.S. Government whose debt
obligations are fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the
timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith
and credit of the U.S. Government. In contrast, a U.S.
Government-sponsored agency is deﬁned as an agency
originally established or chartered by the U.S. Govern-
ment to serve public purposes speciﬁed by the U.S.
Congress but whose debt obligations are not explicitly
guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
Government.
Include, among others, debt securities (but not mortgage-
backed securities) of the following U.S. government
agencies:
(1) Export–Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank)
(2) Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
(3) Government National Mortgage Association
(GNMA)
(4) Maritime Administration
(5) Small Business Administration (SBA)
Include such obligations as:
(1) Small Business Administration (SBA) ‘‘Guaranteed
Loan Pool Certiﬁcates,’’ which represent an undi-
vided interest in a pool of SBA-guaranteed portion of
loans for which the SBA has further guaranteed the
timely payment of scheduled principal and interest
payments. (Exclude SBA ‘‘Guaranteed Interest Cer-
tiﬁcates,’’ which represent a beneﬁcial interest in the
entire SBA-guaranteed portion of an individual loan.
SBA ‘‘Guaranteed Interest Certiﬁcates’’ should be
reported as loans in Schedule HC-C, or, if held for
trading, in Schedule HC, item 5.)
(2) Participation certiﬁcates issued by the Export–Import
Bank and the General Services Administration.

Line Item 4(a)
Residential mortgage pass-through
securities.
Report in the appropriate columns of the appropriate
subitems the amortized cost and fair value of all holdings
of residential mortgage pass-through securities that are
not held for trading. In general, a residential mortgage
pass-through security represents an undivided interest in
a pool of loans secured by 1-4 family residential proper-
ties that provides the holder with a pro rata share of all
principal and interest payments on the residential mort-
gages in the pool, and includes certiﬁcates of participa-
tion in pools of residential mortgages.
Include certiﬁcates of participation in pools of 1-4 family
residential mortgages even though the reporting holding
company was the original holder of the mortgages under-
lying the pool and holds the instruments covering that
pool, as may be the case with GNMA certiﬁcates issued
by the holding company and swaps with FNMA and
FHLMC. Also include U.S. Government-issued participa-
tion certiﬁcates (PCs) that represent a pro rata share of all
principal and interest payments on a pool of resecuritized
participation certiﬁcates that, in turn, are backed by 1-4
family residential mortgages, e.g., FHLMC Giant PCs.
Exclude all holdings of commercial mortgage pass-
through securities, including pass-through securities
backed by loans secured by multifamily (5 or more)
residential properties (report in Schedule HC-B, item
4(c)(1), below). Also exclude all collateralized mortgage
obligations (CMOs), real estate mortgage investment
conduits (REMICs), CMO and REMIC residuals, stripped
mortgage-backed securities (such as interest-only strips
(IOs), principal-only strips (POs), and similar instru-

held for trading. Exclude 1-4 family residential mortgage
pass-through securities that are guaranteed by the Gov-
ernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA) (report
in Schedule HC-B, item 4(a)(1), above).
Line Item 4(a)(3)
Other pass-through securities.
Report in the appropriate columns the amortized cost and
fair value of all holdings of 1-4 family residential mort-
gage pass-through securities issued by others (e.g., other
depository institutions, insurance companies, state and

teed by the U.S. Government and are not held for trading.
If the holding company has issued pass-through securi-
ties backed by a pool of its own 1-4 family residential
mortgages and the certiﬁcates are not guaranteed by the
U.S. Government, any holdings of these pass-through
securities (not held for trading) are to be reported in this

Asset-backed securities and
structured ﬁnancial products:
Line Item 5(a)
Asset-backed securities.
Report in the appropriate columns the amortized cost and
fair value of all asset-backed securities (other than
mortgage-backed securities), including asset-backed com-
mercial paper, not held for trading. Include asset backed
securities issued by non-U.S. issuers. For holding compa-
nies with foreign offices or with $1 billion or more in
total assets, this item must equal Schedule HC-B, sum of
Memorandum items 5(a) through 5(f).
Line Item 5(b)
Structured ﬁnancial products.
Report in the appropriate columns the amortized cost and
fair value of all structured ﬁnancial products not held for
trading. Include cash, synthetic, and hybrid instruments,
including those issued by non-U.S. issuers. For holding
companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, this
item must equal Schedule HC-B, sum of Memorandum
items 6(a) through 6(g). Structured ﬁnancial products
generally convert a pool of assets (such as whole loans,
securitized assets, and bonds) and other exposures (such
as derivatives) into products that are tradable capital
market debt instruments. Some of the more complex
ﬁnancial product structures mix asset classes in order to
create investment products that diversify risk.
(1) A cash instrument means that the instrument repre-
sents a claim against a reference pool of assets.
(2) A synthetic instrument means that the investors do
not have a claim against a reference pool of assets;
rather, the originating bank merely transfers the
inherent credit risk of the reference pool of assets by
Schedule HC-B
FR Y-9C
HC-B-7
Schedule HC-B
March 2022

such means as a credit default swap, a total return
swap, or another arrangement in which the counter-
party agrees upon speciﬁc contractual covenants to
cover a predetermined amount of losses in the loan
pool.
(3) A hybrid instrument means that the instrument is a
mix of both cash and synthetic instruments.
One of the more common cash instrument structured
ﬁnancial products is referred to as a collateralized debt
obligation (CDO). For example, include in this item
investments in CDOs for which the underlying collateral
is a pool of trust preferred securities issued by U.S.
business trusts organized by ﬁnancial institutions or real
estate investment trusts. However, exclude from this item
investments in trust preferred securities issued by a single
U.S. business trust (report in Schedule HC-B, item 6(a),
“Other domestic debt securities”).
Include structured ﬁnancial products that are guaranteed
by U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government-
sponsored agencies, such as FHLMC K-Deals and
Q-Deals (report, if applicable, in Schedule HC-B, Memo-
randum item 6.g, “Other collateral or reference assets,”
below).
Other products include synthetic structured ﬁnancial
products (such as synthetic CDOs) that use credit deriva-
tives and a reference pool of assets, hybrid structured
products that mix cash and synthetic instruments, collat-
eralized bond obligations (CBOs), resecuritizations such
as CDOs squared or cubed (which are CDOs backed
primarily by the tranches of other CDOs), and other
similar structured ﬁnancial products.
Exclude from structured ﬁnancial products:
(1) Mortgage-backed pass-through securities (report in
Schedule HC-B, item 4, above).
(2) Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), real
estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs), CMO
and REMIC residuals, stripped mortgage-backed
securities, and mortgage-backed commercial paper
(report in Schedule HC-B, item 4, above).
(3) Asset-backed commercial paper not held for trading
(report in Schedule HC-B, item 5(a), above).
(4) Asset-backed securities that are primarily secured by
one type of asset (report in Schedule HC-B, item
5(a), above).
(5) Securities backed by loans that are commonly
regarded as asset-backed securities rather than collat-
eralized loan obligations in the marketplace (report in
Schedule HC-B, item 5(a), above).
Line Item 6
Other debt securities.
Report in the appropriate columns the amortized cost and
fair value of all other debt securities that are not held
for trading that cannot properly be reported in Sched-
ule HC-B, items 1 through 5 above.
Exclude from other debt securities:
(1) All holdings of certiﬁcates of participation in pools
of residential mortgages, collateralized mortgage
obligations (CMOs), real estate mortgage investment
conduits (REMICs), CMO and REMIC residuals,
and stripped mortgage-backed securities (such as
interest-only strips (IOs), principal-only strips (POs),
and similar instruments) (report in Schedule HC-B,
item 4 above).
(2) Holdings of bankers acceptances and certiﬁcates of
deposit (CDs), even if the CDs are negotiable or have
CUSIP numbers. (Report holdings of bankers accep-
tances as loans in Schedule HC, item 4(a) if held for
sale; item 4(b) if held for investment; and item 5, if
held for trading. Report holdings of CDs in Schedule
HC, item 1(b) if not held for trading; and item 5, if
held for trading.)
(3) All securities that meet the deﬁnition of an “equity
security” in ASC Topic 321, Investments-Equity
Securities (formerly FASB Statement No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities), for example, common and per-
petual preferred stock. (See, for example, the instruc-
tions to Schedule HC, item 2(c), Schedule HC-B,
item 7, and Schedule HC-F, item 4.)
Line Item 6(a)
Other domestic debt securities.
Include in this item:
(1) Bonds, notes, debenture, equipment trust certiﬁcates,
and commercial paper issued by U.S.-chartered cor-
porations and other U.S. issuers and not reportable

redeemed by the issuing corporation or trust or is
redeemable at the option of the holder, including trust
preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption.
(3) Detached U.S. government security coupons and
ex-coupon U.S. government securities held as the
result of either their purchase or the holding com-
pany’s stripping of such securities and Treasury
receipts such as CATs, TIGRs, COUGARs, LIONs,
and ETRs. (Refer to the Glossary entry for ‘‘coupon
stripping, Treasury receipts, and STRIPS’’ for addi-
tional information.)
Exclude from other domestic debt securities investments
in collateralized debt for which the underlying collateral
is a pool of trust preferred securities issues by U.S.
business trusts (report as structured ﬁnancial products in
Schedule HC-B, item 5(b)).
Line Item 6(b)
Other foreign debt securities.
Report in the appropriate columns the amortized cost and
fair value of all other foreign debt securities not held for
trading issued by non-U.S.-chartered corporations, for-
eign governments, or special international organizations.

cates, and commercial paper issued by non-U.S.-
chartered corporations.
(2) Debt securities issued by foreign governmental units.
(3) Debt securities issued by international organizations
such as the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (World Bank), Inter-American
Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank.
(4) Preferred stock of non-U.S.-chartered corporations
that by its terms either must be redeemed by the
issuing enterprise or is redeemable at the option of
the investor (i.e., redeemable or limited-life preferred
stock).
NOTE: Investments in equity securities, including invest-
ment in mutual funds, with readily determinable fair
values not held for trading that were previously report-
able in Schedule HC-B, item 7, columns C and D, should
be reported in Schedule HC, item 2(c), “Equity securities

Line Item 7
Unallocated portfolio layer fair value
hedge basis adjustments.
Report the total amount of portfolio layer fair value
hedge basis adjustments (FVHBAs) not allocated to
individual AFS debt securities in column C only.
As deﬁned in Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), “Fair Value Hedg-
ing Portfolio Layer Method” (ASU 2022-01), the port-
folio layer method was added to allow entities to apply
hedge accounting to a single closed portfolio of ﬁnancial
assets or one or more beneﬁcial interests secured by a
portfolio of ﬁnancial instruments that is not expected to
be affected by prepayments, defaults, or other factors
affecting the timing and amount of cash ﬂows for the
designated hedge period. Under ASU 2022-01, different
types of qualifying assets can be grouped together in a
portfolio layer hedge.
Per the standard, an institution should not adjust the
recorded investment or the discount rate of the individual
assets or individual beneﬁcial interest included in the
closed portfolio for a basis adjustment that is maintained
on a closed portfolio basis. As such, an institution that
applies the portfolio layer method to a closed portfolio of
AFS debt securities should not allocate the portfolio layer
FVHBAs to a more granular level. Institutions should
report these unallocated amounts in this item 7, col-
umn C.
If the amount to be reported in this item represents a
reduction in the amounts reported in Schedule HC-B,
items 1 through 6.b, column C, report the amount with a
minus (-) sign.

the securities are pledged), as performance bonds under
futures or forward contracts, or for any other purpose.
Include as pledged securities:
(1) Held-to-maturity debt securities, available-for-sale

(2) Held-to-maturity debt securities, available-for-sale
debt securities, and equity securities with readily
determinable fair values not held for trading securi-
ties held by consolidated variable interest entities
(VIEs) that can be used only to settle obligations of
the same consolidated VIEs (the amounts of which
are also reported in Schedule HC-V, item 1(b).
(3) Held-to-maturity debt securities, available-for-sale
debt securities, and equity securities with readily
determinable fair values not held for trading owned
by consolidated insurance subsidiaries and held in
custodial trusts that are pledged to insurance compa-
nies external to the consolidated holding company.
Line Item M2
Remaining maturity or next
repricing date of debt securities.
Report in memorandum items 2(a) through 2(c) below
the remaining maturity or next repricing date of debt
securities held by the consolidated holding company that
are included in items 1 through 6(b) above. Report the
amortized cost of held-to-maturity debt securities and the
fair value of available-for-sale debt securities as reported
in columns A and D above in the appropriate subitems.
Exclude from memorandum item 2 the holding com-
pany’s holdings of equity securities with readily deter-
minable fair values not held for trading (reported in
Schedule HC, item 2(c)) (e.g., investments in mutual
funds, common stock, preferred stock). Also exclude
those debt securities that are reported as ‘‘nonaccrual’’ in
Schedule HC-N, item 10, column C.
For purposes of this memorandum item, the following
deﬁnitions apply:
Remaining maturity is the amount of time remaining
from the report date until the ﬁnal contractual maturity of
the instrument without regard to the instrument’s repay-
ment schedule, if any.
A ﬁxed interest rate is a rate that is speciﬁed at the
origination of the transaction, is ﬁxed and invariable
during the term of the debt security, and is known to both
the borrower and the lender. Also treated as a ﬁxed
interest rate is a predetermined interest rate which is a
rate that changes during the term of the debt security on a
predetermined basis, with the exact rate of interest over
the life of the debt security known with certainty to both
the borrower and the lender when the debt security is
acquired.
A ﬂoating rate is a rate that varies, or can vary, in relation
to an index, to some other interest rate such as the rate on
certain U.S. Government securities or the ‘‘prime rate,’’
or to some other variable criterion the exact value of
which cannot be known in advance. Therefore, the exact
rate the debt security carries at any subsequent time
cannot be known at the time of origination.
When the rate on a debt security with a ﬂoating rate has
reached a contractual ﬂoor or ceiling level, the debt
security is to be treated as “ﬁxed rate” rather than as
“ﬂoating rate” until the rate is again free to ﬂoat.
Next repricing date is the date the interest rate on a
ﬂoating rate debt security can next change in accordance
with the terms of the contract (without regard to the
security’s repayment schedule, if any, or expected pre-
payments) or the contractual maturity date of the secu-
rity, whichever is earlier.
Holding companies whose records or information sys-
tems provide data on the ﬁnal contractual maturities, next
repricing dates, and expected average lives of their debt
securities for time periods that closely approximate the
maturity periods speciﬁed in Memorandum items 2(a)
through 2(c) (e.g., 359 or 360 days rather than 1 year)
may use these dates to complete Memorandum items 2(a)
through 2(c).
For debt securities with scheduled contractual payments,
holding companies whose records or information systems
provide repricing data that take into account these sched-
uled contractual payments, with or without the effect of
anticipated prepayments, may adjust these data in an
Schedule HC-B
HC-B-10
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-B
December 2020

appropriate manner to derive reasonable estimates for the
ﬁnal contractual maturities of ﬁxed rate debt securities
and ﬂoating rate debt securities and the next repricing
dates of ﬂoating rate debt securities.
Callable ﬁxed rate debt securities should be reported in
Memorandum items 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) without regard to
their next call date unless the security has actually been
called. When ﬁxed rate debt securities have been called,
they should be reported on the basis of the time remain-
ing until the call date. Callable ﬂoating rate debt securi-
ties should be reported on the basis of their next repricing
date without regard to their next call date if the security
has not been called. Those that have been called should
be reported based on the earlier of their next repricing
date or their actual call date.
Fixed rate mortgage pass-through securities (such as
those guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage
Association (GNMA) or issued by the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), the Federal
National Mortgage Association (FNMA), and certain
banks, savings associations, and securities dealers) and
ﬁxed rate Small Business Administration (SBA) “Guar-
anteed Loan Pool Certiﬁcates” should be reported on the
basis of the time remaining until their ﬁnal contractual
maturity without regard to either expected prepayments
or scheduled contractual payments. Floating rate mort-
gage pass-through securities and SBA “Guaranteed Loan
Pool Certiﬁcates” should be reported on the basis of their
next repricing date.
Fixed rate debt securities that provide the reporting
holding company with the option to redeem them at one
or more speciﬁed dates prior to their contractual maturity
date, so-called “put bonds,” should be reported on the
basis of the time remaining until the next “put” date.
Floating rate “put bonds” should be reported on the basis
of their next repricing date without regard to “put” dates
if the holding company has not exercised the put. If a
“put” has been exercised but the security has not yet been
repaid, the “put” bond should be reported based on the
earlier of its next repricing date or its scheduled repay-
ment date.
Zero coupon debt securities, including U.S. Treasury
bills, should be treated as ﬁxed rate debt securities for
purposes of this Memorandum item.

Report in this item all securities held by the consolidated
holding company with a remaining maturity or amount of
time remaining until next repricing date of over ﬁve
years.
Note: Memorandum item 3 is to be completed semiannu-
ally in the June and December reports only.
Line Item M3
Amortized cost of held-to-maturity
securities sold or transferred to available-for-sale or
trading securities during the calendar year-to-date.
If the reporting holding company has sold any held-to-
maturity debt securities or has transferred any held-to-
maturity debt securities to the available-for-sale or to
trading securities during the calendar year-to-date, report
the total amortized cost of these held-to-maturity debt
securities as of their date of sale or transfer.
Exclude the amortized cost of any held-to-maturity debt
security that has been sold near enough to (e.g., within
three months of) its maturity date (or call date if exercise
of the call is probable) that interest rate risk is substan-
tially eliminated as a pricing factor. Also exclude the
amortized cost of any held-to-maturity debt security that
has been sold after the collection of a substantial portion
(i.e., at least 85 percent) of the principal outstanding at
acquisition due to prepayments on the debt security, or, if
the debt security is a ﬁxed rate security, due to scheduled
payments payable in equal installments (both principal
and interest) over its term.

Line Item M4
Structured notes.
Report in this item all structured notes included in the
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale accounts and
reported in Schedule HC-B. In general, structured notes
are debt securities whose cash ﬂow characteristics (coupon
rate, redemption amount, or stated maturity) depend upon
one or more indices and/or that have embedded forwards
or options or are otherwise commonly known as ‘‘struc-
tured notes.’’ Include as structured notes any asset-
backed securities (other than mortgage-backed securities)
which possess the aforementioned characteristics.
Structured notes include, but are not limited to, the
following common structures:
(1) Floating rate debt securities whose payment of inter-
est is based upon:
(a) a single index of a Constant Maturity Treasury
(CMT) rate or a Cost of Funds Index (COFI), or
(b) changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
However, exclude from structured notes all U.S.
Treasury Inﬂation-Protected Securities (TIPS).
(2) Step-up Bonds.
Step-up securities initially pay the
investor an above-market yield for a short noncall
period and then, if not called, “step up” to a higher
coupon rate (which will be below current market
rates). The investor initially receives a higher yield
because of having implicitly sold one or more call
options. A step-up bond may continue to contain call
options even after the bond has stepped up to the
higher coupon rate. A multistep bond has a series of
ﬁxed and successively higher coupons over its life.
At each call date, if the bond is not called, the coupon
rate increases.
(3) Index Amortizing Notes (IANs).
IANs repay prin-
cipal according to a predetermined amortization
schedule that is linked to the level of a speciﬁc index
(usually the London Interbank Offered Rate—
LIBOR—or a speciﬁed prepayment rate). As market
interest rates increase (or prepayment rates decrease),
the maturity of an IAN extends, similar to that of a
collateralized mortgage obligation. When the princi-
pal payments on these notes are indexed to the
prepayment performance of a reference pool of mort-
gages or a reference mortgage-backed security, but
the notes themselves are not collateralized by the
mortgages or the mortgage-backed security, the notes
are sometimes marketed as Prepayment-Linked Notes.
(4) Dual Index Notes.
These bonds have coupon rates
that are determined by the difference between
two market indices, typically the Constant Maturity
Treasury rate (CMT) and LIBOR. These bonds often
have a ﬁxed coupon rate for a brief period, followed
by a longer period of variable rates, e.g., 8 percent
ﬁxed for two years, then 10-year CMT plus 300 basis
points minus three-month LIBOR.
(5) De-leveraged Bonds.
These bonds pay investors
according to a formula that is based upon a fraction
of the increase or decrease in a speciﬁed index, such
as the CMT rate or the prime rate. For example,
the coupon might be the 10-year CMT rate multiplied
by 0.5, plus 150 basis points. The deleveraging
multiplier (0.5) causes the coupon to lag overall
movements in market yields. A leveraged bond
would involve a multiplier greater than 1.
(6) Range Bonds.
Range bonds (or accrual bonds) pay
the investor an above-market coupon rate as long as
the reference rate is between levels established at
issue. For each day that the reference rate is outside
this range, the bonds earn no interest. For example, if
LIBOR is the reference rate, a bond might pay
LIBOR plus 75 basis points for each day that LIBOR
is between 3.5 and 5.0 percent. When LIBOR is less
than 3.5 percent or more than 5 percent, the bond
would accrue no interest.
(7) Inverse Floaters.
These bonds have coupons that
increase as rates decline and decrease as rates rise.
The coupon is based upon a formula, such as 12 per-
cent minus three-month LIBOR.
Exclude from structured notes ﬂoating rate debt securi-
ties denominated in U.S. dollars whose payment of
interest is based upon a single index of a Treasury bill
rate, the prime rate, or LIBOR and which do not contain
adjusting caps, adjusting ﬂoors, leverage, or variable
principal redemption. Furthermore, debt securities that
do not possess the aforementioned characteristics of a
structured note need not be reported as structured notes
solely because they are callable as of a speciﬁed date at
a speciﬁed price. In addition, debt securities that in the
past possessed the characteristics of a structured note, but
which have ‘‘fallen through’’ their structures (e.g., all of
the issuer’s call options have expired and there are no
Schedule HC-B
HC-B-12
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-B
June 2018

more adjustments to the interest rate on the security),
need not be reported as structured notes.
Generally, municipal and corporate securities that have
periodic call options should not be reported as structured
notes. Although many of these securities have features
similar to those found in some structured notes (e.g.,
step-ups, which generally remain callable after a step-up
date), they are not commonly known as structured notes.
Examples of such callable securities that should not be
reported as structured notes include:
(1) Callable municipal and corporate bonds which have
single (or multiple) explicit call dates and then can be
called on any interest payment date after the
last explicit call date (i.e., they are continuously
callable).
(2) Callable federal agency securities that have continu-
ous call features after an explicit call date, except
step-up bonds (which are structured notes).
The mere existence of simple caps and ﬂoors does not
necessarily make a security a structured note. Securities
with adjusting caps or ﬂoors (i.e., caps or ﬂoors that
change over time), however, are structured notes. There-
fore, the following types of securities should not be
reported as structured notes:
(1) Variable rate securities, including Small Business
Administration “Guaranteed Loan Pool Certiﬁcates,”
unless they have features of securities which are
commonly known as structured notes (i.e., they are
inverse, range, or de-leveraged ﬂoaters, index amor-
tizing notes, dual index or variable principal redemp-
tion or step-up bonds), or have adjusting caps or
ﬂoors.
(2) Mortgage-backed securities.
Line Item M4(a)
Amortized cost of structured
notes.
Report the amortized cost of all structured notes included
in the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale accounts.
The amortized cost of these securities should also be
reported in columns A and C of the body of Sched-
ule HC-B.
Line Item M4(b)
Fair value of structured notes.
Report the fair (market) value of structured notes reported
in memorandum item 4(a) above. The fair value of these
securities should also be reported in columns B and D of
the body of Schedule HC-B. Do not combine or other-
wise net the fair value of any structured note with the fair
or book value of any related asset, liability, or off-
balance-sheet derivative instrument.
Line Item M5
Asset-backed securities.
Note: Memorandum item 5 is to be completed by
holding companies with $10 billion or more in total

dum items 5(a) through 5(f) must equal Schedule HC-B,
item 5(a).
For purposes of categorizing asset-backed securities in
Schedule HC-B, Memorandum items 5(a) through 5(f),
below, each individual asset-backed security should be
included in the item that most closely describes the
predominant type of asset that collateralizes the security
and this categorization should be used consistently over
time. For example, an asset-backed security may be
collateralized by automobile loans to both individuals
and business enterprises. If the prospectus for this asset-
backed security or other available information indicates
that these automobile loans are predominantly loans to
individuals, the security should be reported in Schedule
HC-B, Memorandum item 5(c), as being collateralized
by automobile loans.

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Loan and Lease Financing Receivables
Schedule HC-C
General Instructions
Loans and lease ﬁnancing receivables are extensions of
credit resulting from either direct negotiation between the
holding company or its consolidated subsidiaries and its
customers or the purchase of such assets from others.
(See the Glossary entries for “Loan”’ and for “Lease
Accounting” for further information.)
All reporting holding companies must complete this
schedule regardless of whether or not it has foreign or
domestic offices. This schedule has two columns for
information on loans and lease ﬁnancing receivables.
Column A provides loan and lease detail for the fully
consolidated holding company and column B provides
detail on loans and leases held by the domestic offices of
the reporting holding company. (See the Glossary entry
for “Domestic Office” for the deﬁnition of this term.)
Report all loans and leases that the holding company has
the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or
until maturity or payoff, i.e., loans and leases held for
investment, in Schedule HC-C. Also report in Schedule
HC-C all loans and leases held for sale as part of the
consolidated holding company’s mortgage banking activi-
ties or activities of a similar nature involving other types
of loans. Include the fair value of all loans held for
investment and all loans held for sale that the holding
company has elected to report at fair value under a fair
value option. Loans reported at fair value in Schedule
HC-C should include only the fair value of the funded
portion of the loan. If the unfunded portion of the loan, if
any, is reported at fair value, this fair value should be
reported as an “Other asset” or an “Other liability,” as
appropriate, in Schedule HC, item 11 or item 20, respec-
tively.
If the holding company has elected to apply the fair value
option to any loans held for investment or held for sale, it
also must report the fair value and unpaid principal
balance of these loans in the appropriate subitems of
Schedule HC-Q, Memorandum items 3 and 4, respec-
tively.
Exclude from Schedule HC-C all loans and leases classi-
ﬁed as trading (report in Schedule HC, item 5, “Trading
assets,” and, in the appropriate items of Schedule HC-D,
Trading Assets and Liabilities, and Schedule HC-Q, Finan-
cial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a
Recurring Basis, if applicable).
When a loan is acquired (through origination or pur-
chase) with the intent or expectation that it may or will be
sold at some indeﬁnite date in the future, the loan should
be reported as held for sale or held for investment, based
on facts and circumstances, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and related supervisory
guidance. In addition, a loan acquired and held for
securitization purposes should be reported as a loan held
for sale, provided the securitization transaction will be
accounted for as a sale under ASC Topic 860, Transfers
and Servicing. Notwithstanding the above, holding com-
panies may classify loans as trading if the holding
company applies fair value accounting, with changes in
fair value reported in current earnings, and manages
these assets and liabilities as trading positions, subject to
the controls and applicable regulatory guidance related to
trading activities. For example, a holding company would
generally not classify a loan that meets these criteria as a
trading asset unless the holding company holds the loan
for one of the following purposes: (a) for market making
activities, including such activities as accumulating loans
for sale or securitization; (b) to beneﬁt from actual or
expected price movements; or (c) to lock in arbitrage
proﬁts.
Loans held for sale (not classiﬁed as trading in accordance
with the preceding instruction) shall be reported in Sched-
ule HC-C at the lower of cost or fair value as of the report
date, except for those that the holding company has
elected to account for at fair value under a fair value

option. For loans held for sale that are reported at the lower
of cost or fair value, the amount by which cost exceeds fair
value, if any, shall be accounted for as a valuation allow-
ance. For further information, see ASC Subtopic 948-310,
Financial Services-Mortgage Banking – Receivables,
ASC Subtopic 310-10, Receivables – Overall, and the
March 26, 2001, Interagency Guidance on Certain Loans
Held for Sale.
Holding companies should report loans and leases held
for investment in this schedule without any deduction for
allowances for credit losses on loans and leases or any
allocated transfer risk reserves related to loans and leases,
which are to be reported in Schedule HC, item 4.c,
“Allowance for credit losses on loans and leases.”
Each item in this schedule should be reported net
of (1) unearned income (to the extent possible)
and (2) deposits accumulated for the payment of personal
loans (hypothecated deposits). Net unamortized loan fees
represent an adjustment of the loan yield, and shall be
reported in this schedule in the same manner as unearned
income on loans, i.e., deducted from the related loan
balances (to the extent possible) or deducted from total
loans in Schedule HC-C, item 11, “LESS: Any unearned
income on loans reﬂected in items 1–9 above.” Net
unamortized direct loan origination costs shall be added
to the related loan balances in each item in this schedule.
(See the Glossary entry for “Loan Fees” for further
information.)
“Purchased credit-deteriorated loans” are acquired indi-
vidual loans (or acquired groups of loans with similar
risk characteristics) accounted for in accordance with
ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses,
that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a
more-than-insigniﬁcant deterioration in credit quality
since origination, as determined by the acquiring institu-
tion’s assessment. Unless accounted for at fair value
under a fair value option, purchased credit-deteriorated
loans should be reported in Schedule HC-C, at amortized
cost. Any noncredit discount or premium on a purchased
credit-deteriorated loan should not be reported as unearned
income in Schedule HC-C, item 11.
If, as a result of a change in circumstances, the holding
company regains control of a loan previously accounted
for appropriately as having been sold because one or
more of the conditions for sale accounting in ASC Topic
860 are no longer met, such a change should be accounted
for in the same manner as a purchase of the loan from the
former transferee (purchaser) in exchange for liabilities
assumed. The rebooked loan must be reported as a loan
asset in Schedule HC-C either as a loan held for sale or a
loan held for investment, based on facts and circum-
stances, in accordance with generally accepted account-
ing principles. This accounting and reporting treatment
applies, for example, to U.S. Government-guaranteed or
insured residential mortgage loans backing Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage-
backed securities that a holding company services after it
has securitized the loans in a transfer accounted for as a
sale. If and when individual loans later meet delinquency
criteria speciﬁed by GNMA, the loans are eligible for
repurchase, the holding company is deemed to have
regained effective control over these loans, and the
delinquent loans must be brought back onto the holding
company’s books as loan assets.
Exclude all intracompany (i.e., between subsidiaries of
the consolidated holding company) transactions and all
loans and leases held for trading purposes.
All loans are classiﬁed according to security, borrower, or
purpose. All loans satisfying the criteria in the Glossary
entry for “Loan Secured by Real Estate” (except those to
states and political subdivisions in the U.S.) should be
categorized as “Loans secured by real estate” in Sched-
ule HC-C. Loans secured by other collateral, such as
securities, inventory, or automobiles would require fur-
ther examination on both purpose and borrower to prop-
erly categorize the loans in Schedule HC-C. For loan
categories in Schedule HC-C that include certain loans to
individuals, the term “individual” may include a trust or
other entity that acts of behalf of (or in place of) an
individual or a group of individuals for purposes of
obtaining the loan. Loans covering two or more classiﬁ-
cations are sometimes difficult to classify. In such
instances, classify the entire loan according to the major
criterion.
Report in this schedule all loans that the reporting
holding company or its consolidated subsidiaries have
sold under repurchase agreements. Also report all loans
and leases on the books of the reporting holding company
even if on the report date they are past due and collection
is doubtful. Exclude any loans or leases the holding
company has sold or charged off. Also exclude the fair
value of any assets received in full or partial satisfaction
of a loan or lease (unless the asset received is itself
reportable as a loan or lease) and any loans for which the

holding company has obtained physical possession of the
underlying collateral regardless of whether formal fore-
closure or repossession proceedings have been instituted
against the borrower. Refer to the Glossary entries for
“Loan Modiﬁcations to Borrowers Experiencing Finan-
cial Difficulty” and “Foreclosed Assets” for further dis-
cussions of these topics.
When a holding company acquires either (1) a portion of
an entire loan that does not meet the deﬁnition of a
participating interest (i.e., a nonqualifying loan participa-
tion) or (2) a qualifying participating interest in a transfer
that does not does not meet all of the conditions for sale
accounting, it should normally report the loan participa-
tion or participating interest in Schedule HC, item 4(b),
“Loans and leases, held for investment.” The holding
company also should report the loan participation or
participating interest in Schedule HC-C, in the loan
category appropriate to the underlying loan, e.g., as a
“commercial and industrial loan”’ in item 4 or as a “loan
secured by real estate” in item 1. See the Glossary entry
for “Transfers of Financial Assets” for further informa-
tion.
Exclude, for purposes of this schedule, the following:
(1) Federal funds sold (in domestic offices), i.e., all loans
of immediately available funds (in domestic offices)
that mature in one business day or roll over under a
continuing contract, excluding funds lent in the form
of securities purchased under agreements to resell.
Report federal funds sold (in domestic offices) in
Schedule HC, item 3(a). However, report overnight
lending for commercial and industrial purposes as
loans in this schedule. Also report lending transac-
tions in foreign offices involving immediately avail-
able funds with an original maturity of one business
day or under a continuing contract that are not
securities resale agreements as loans in this schedule.
(2) Lending transactions in the form of securities pur-
chased under agreements to resell (report in Schedule
HC, item 3(b), “Securities purchased under agree-
ments to resell”).
(3) Contracts of sale or other loans indirectly represent-
ing other real estate (report in Schedule HC, item 7,
“Other real estate owned”).
(4) Undisbursed loan funds, sometimes referred to as
incomplete loans or loans in process, unless the
borrower is liable for and pays the interest thereon. If
interest is being paid by the borrower on the undis-
bursed proceeds, the amounts of such undisbursed
funds should be included in both loans and deposits.
(Do not include loan commitments that have not yet
been taken down, even if fees have been paid; see
Schedule HC-L, item 1).
(5) All holdings of commercial paper (report in Schedule
HC, item 5, if held for trading; report in Schedule
HC-B, item 4(b), “Other mortgage-backed securi-
ties,” item 5, “Asset-backed securities,” or item 6,
“Other debt securities,” as appropriate, if held for
purposes other than trading).

ment (i.e., the process of improving land - laying sewers,
water pipes, etc.) preparatory to erecting new structures
or (b) the on-site construction of industrial, commercial,
residential, or farm buildings. For purposes of this item,
‘‘construction’’ includes not only construction of new
structures, but also additions or alterations to existing
structures and the demolition of existing structures to
make way for new structures.
Also include in this item:
(1) Loans secured by vacant land, except land known to
be used or usable for agricultural purposes, such as
crop and livestock production (which should be
reported in Schedule HC-C, item 1.b, below, as loans
secured by farmland).
(2) Loans secured by real estate the proceeds of which
are to be used to acquire and improve developed and
undeveloped property.

Schedule HC-C
June 2018

Loans written as combination construction-permanent
loans secured by real estate should be reported in this
item until construction is completed or principal amorti-
zation payments begin, whichever comes ﬁrst. When the
ﬁrst of these events occurs, the loans should begin to be
reported in the real estate loan category in Schedule
HC-C, item 1, appropriate to the real estate collateral. For
purposes of these reports, a combination construction-
permanent loan arises when the lender enters into a
contractual agreement with the original borrower at the
time the construction loan is originated to also provide
the original borrower with permanent ﬁnancing that
amortizes principal after construction is completed and a
certiﬁcate of occupancy is obtained (if applicable). This
construction-permanent loan structure is intended to
apply to situations where, at the time the construction
loan is originated, the original borrower:
• Is expected to be the owner-occupant of the property
upon completion of construction and receipt of a
certiﬁcate of occupancy (if applicable), for example,
where the ﬁnancing is being provided to the original
borrower for the construction and permanent ﬁnancing
of the borrower’s residence or place of business, or
• Is not expected to be the owner-occupant of the
property, but repayment of the permanent loan will be
derived from rental income associated with the prop-
erty being constructed after receipt of a certiﬁcate of
occupancy (if applicable) rather than from the sale of
the property being constructed.
All construction loans secured by real estate, other than
combination construction-permanent loans as described
above, should continue to be reported in this item after
construction is completed unless and until (1) the loan is
reﬁnanced into a new permanent loan by the reporting
holding company or is otherwise repaid, (2) the holding
company acquires or otherwise obtains physical posses-
sion of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the
debt, or (3) the loan is charged off. For purposes of these
reports, a construction loan is deemed to be reﬁnanced
into a new permanent loan only if the holding company
originates:
• An amortizing permanent loan to a new borrower
(unrelated to the original borrower) who has purchased
the real property, or
• A prudently underwritten new amortizing permanent
loan at market terms to the original borrower including
an appropriate interest rate, maturity, and loan-to-value
ratio – that is no longer dependent on the sale of the
property for repayment. The loan should have a clearly
identiﬁed ongoing source of repayment sufficient to
service the required principal and interest payments
over a reasonable and customary period relative to the
type of property securing the new loan. A new loan to
the original borrower not meeting these criteria (includ-
ing a new loan on interest-only terms or a new loan
with a short-term balloon maturity that is inconsistent
with the ongoing source of repayment criterion) should
continue to be reported as a ‘‘Construction, land devel-
opment, and other land loan’’ in the appropriate sub-
item of Schedule HC-C, item 1(a).
Exclude loans to ﬁnance construction and land develop-
ment that are not secured by real estate (report in other
items of Schedule HC-C, as appropriate).

1–4 family residential construc-
tion loans.
Report in column B the amount outstanding of 1–4 family
residential construction loans, i.e., loans for the purpose of
constructing 1–4 family residential properties, which will

ties” is deﬁned in Schedule HC-C, item 1(c), below. “1–4
family residential construction loans” include:
• Construction loans to developers secured by tracts of
land on which 1–4 family residential properties, includ-
ing townhouses, are being constructed.
• Construction loans secured by individual parcels of land
on which single 1–4 family residential properties are
being constructed.
• Construction loans secured by buildings in which indi-
vidual condominium dwelling units or individual coop-
erative housing units are being constructed, even if the
buildings have ﬁve or more units, where repayment will
come from sales of individual condominium dwelling
units or interests in individual cooperative housing
units, which are 1-4 family residential properties.
• Construction loans secured by single-family dwelling
units in detached or semi-detached structures, including
manufactured housing.
• Construction loans secured by duplex units and town-
houses, excluding garden apartment projects where the

total number of units that will secure the permanent
mortgage is greater than four.
• Combination land and construction loans on 1–4 family
residential properties, regardless of the current stage of
construction or development.
• Combination construction-permanent loans on 1–4
family residential properties until construction is com-
pleted or principal amortization payments begin, which-
ever comes ﬁrst.
• Loans secured by apartment buildings undergoing con-
version to condominiums or cooperatives, regardless of
the extent of planned construction or renovation, where
repayment will come from sales of individual condo-
minium dwelling units or interests in individual coop-
erative housing units, which are 1-4 family residential
properties.

properties where the buyer will not assume the same
loan, even if construction is completed or principal
amortization payments have begun.

land development and other land loans.
Report in column B the amount outstanding of all
construction loans for purposes other than constructing
1–4 family residential properties, all land development
loans, and all other land loans. Include loans for the

land, unless the same loan ﬁnances the construction of
1–4 family residential properties on the property.
Line Item 1(b)
Secured by farmland.
Report in this item loans secured by farmland and
improvements thereon, as evidenced by mortgages or
other liens. Farmland includes all land known to be used
or usable for agricultural purposes, such as crop and
livestock production. Farmland includes grazing or pas-
ture land, whether tillable or not and whether wooded or
not.
Include loans secured by farmland that are guaranteed by
the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) and extended,
collected, and serviced by a party other than the FmHA.
Exclude, however, loans extended, serviced, collected,
and insured by FmHA (report in Schedule HC-B, item 2,
‘‘U.S. government agency obligations.’’) Also exclude
loans for farm property construction and land develop-
ment purpose (report in Schedule HC-C, item 1(a)
above).
Line Item 1(c)
Secured by 1–4 family residential
properties.
Report in this item open-end and closed-end loans
secured by real estate as evidenced by mortgages (FHA,
FmHA, VA, or conventional) or other liens on the
following:
(1) Nonfarm property containing 1 to 4 dwelling units
(including vacation homes) or more than 4 dwelling
units if each is separated from other units by divid-
ing walls that extend from ground to roof (e.g., row
houses, townhouses, or the like).
(2) Mobile homes where (a) state laws deﬁne the pur-
chase or holding of a mobile home as the purchase or
holding of real property and where (b) the loan to
purchase the mobile home is secured by that mobile
home as evidenced by a mortgage or other instrument
on real property.
(3) Individual condominium dwelling units and loans
secured by an interest in individual cooperative hous-
ing units, even if in a building with ﬁve or more
dwelling units.
(4) Housekeeping dwellings with commercial units com-
bined where use is primarily residential and where
only 1 to 4 family dwelling units are involved.
A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a revolving
open-end line of credit secured by a lien on a 1-to-4
family residential property that generally provides a draw
period followed by a repayment period. During the draw
period, a borrower has revolving access to unused
amounts under a speciﬁed line of credit. During the
repayment period, the borrower can no longer draw on
the line of credit and the outstanding principal is either
due immediately in a balloon payment or repaid over the
remaining term through monthly payments. HELOCs in
the draw period or in the repayment period should be
reported in Schedule HC-C, Part I, item 1.c.(1).1 Revolv-
ing open-end lines of credit that are no longer in the draw
1. All HELOCs that convert to non-revolving, closed-end status on or
after January 1, 2021, must be reported as open-end loans in Schedule
HC-C, Part I, 1.c.(1). A holding company that, as of March 31, 2020,
reports HELOCs that convert to non-revolving, closed-end status as closed-
end loans in Schedule HC-C, Part I, item 1.c.(2)(a) or 1.c.(2) (b), as

period and have converted to non-revolving closed-end
status also should be reported in Schedule HC-C, Part I,
Memorandum item 15.
Reverse 1–4 family residential mortgages should be
reported in the appropriate subitem based on whether
they are closed-end or open-end mortgages. A reverse
mortgage is an arrangement in which a homeowner
borrows against the equity in his/her home and receives
cash either in a lump sum or through periodic payments.
However, unlike a traditional mortgage loan, no payment
is required until the borrower no longer uses the home as
his or her principal residence. Cash payments to the
borrower after closing, if any, and accrued interest are
added to the principal balance. These loans may have
caps on their maximum principal balance or they may
have clauses that permit the cap on the maximum princi-
pal balance to be increased under certain circumstances.
Homeowners generally have one of the following options
for receiving tax free loan proceeds from a reverse
mortgage: (1) one lump sum payment; (2) a line of credit;
(3) ﬁxed monthly payments to homeowner either for a
speciﬁed term or for as long as the homeowner lives in
the home; or (4) a combination of the above. Reverse
mortgages that provide for a lump sum payment to the
borrower at closing, with no ability for the borrower to
receive additional funds under the mortgage at a later
date, should be reported as closed-end loans in Schedule
HC-C, item 1(c)(2). Normally, closed-end reverse mort-
gages are ﬁrst liens and would be reported in Schedule
HC-C, item 1(c)(2)(a). Reverse mortgages that are struc-
tured like home equity lines of credit in that they provide
the borrower with additional funds after closing (either as
ﬁxed monthly payments, under a line of credit, or both)
should be reported as open-end loans in Schedule HC-C,
item 1(c)(1). Open-end reverse mortgages also are nor-
mally ﬁrst liens. Where there is a combination of both a
lump sum payment to the borrower at closing and
payments after the closing of the loan, the reverse
mortgage should be reported as an open-end loan in
Schedule HC-C, item 1(c)(1).
Exclude loans for 1-to-4 family residential property
construction and land development purposes (report in
Schedule HC-C, item 1(a)). Also, exclude loans secured
by vacant lots in established single-family residential
sections or in areas set aside primarily for 1-to-4 family
homes (report in Schedule HC-C, item 1(a)).
Line Item 1(c)(1)

end lines of credit secured by 1 to 4 family residential
properties, i.e. HELOCs.
Include revolving, open-end lines of credit secured by
1-to-4 family residential properties for which the draw
periods have ended and the loans have converted to
non-revolving closedend status.1 After their conversion,
such loans should also be reported in Schedule HC-C,
Part I, Memorandum item 15 beginning March 31, 2021.
Also include amounts drawn on a HELOC during its
draw period that the borrower has converted to a closed-
end loan before the end of this period (sometimes
referred to as a HELOC ﬂex product).

ment hotels) used primarily to accommodate house-
holds on a more or less permanent basis.
(2) 5 or more unit housekeeping dwellings with commer-
cial units combined where use is primarily residential.
(3) Cooperative-type apartment buildings containing 5 or

Exclude loans for multifamily residential property con-
struction and land development purposes and loans
secured by vacant lots in established multifamily residen-
tial sections or in areas set aside primarily for multifam-
ily residential properties (report in item 1(a)(2)). Also
exclude loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential proper-
ties (report in item 1(e)).

Secured by nonfarm nonresidential
properties.
Report in the appropriate subitem of column B loans
secured by real estate as evidenced by mortgages or other

business and industrial properties, hotels, motels,
churches, hospitals, educational and charitable institu-
tions, dormitories, clubs, lodges, association buildings,
‘‘homes’’ for aged persons and orphans, golf courses,
recreational facilities, and similar properties.
Exclude loans for nonfarm nonresidential property con-
struction and land development purposes (report in
Schedule HC-C, item 1(a)).
For purposes of reporting loans in Schedule HC-C, items
1(e)(1) and 1(e)(2), below, the determination as to
whether a nonfarm nonresidential property is considered
“owner-occupied” should be made upon acquisition
(origination or purchase) of the loan. Once a holding
company determines whether a loan should be reported
as “owner-occupied” or not, this determination need not
be reviewed thereafter.
Line Item 1(e)(1)
Loans secured by
owner-occupied nonfarm nonresidential properties.
Report in column B the amount of loans secured by
owner-occupied nonfarm nonresidential properties.
“Loans secured by owner-occupied nonfarm nonresiden-
tial properties” are those nonfarm nonresidential property
loans for which the primary source of repayment is the
cash ﬂow from the ongoing operations and activities
conducted by the party, or an affiliate of the party, who
owns the property. Thus, for loans secured by owner-
occupied nonfarm nonresidential properties, the primary
source of repayment is not derived from third party,
nonaffiliated, rental income associated with the property
(i.e., any such rental income is less than 50 percent of the
source of repayment) or the proceeds of the sale, reﬁ-
nancing, or permanent ﬁnancing of the property. Include
loans secured by hospitals, golf courses, recreational
facilities, and car washes unless the property is owned by
an investor who leases the property to the operator who,
in turn, is not related to or affiliated with the investor (in
which case, the loan should be reported in Schedule
HC-C, item 1(e)(2), below). Also include loans secured
by churches unless the property is owned by an investor
who leases the property to the congregation (in which
case, the loan should be reported in Schedule HC-C, item
1(e)(2), below).
Line Item 1(e)(2)
Loans secured by other nonfarm
nonresidential properties.
Report in column B the amount of nonfarm nonresiden-
tial real estate loans that are not secured by owner-
occupied nonfarm nonresidential properties.
“Loans secured by other nonfarm nonresidential proper-
ties” are those nonfarm nonresidential property loans
where the primary source of repayment is derived from
rental income associated with the property (i.e., loans for
which 50 percent or more of the source of repayment
comes from third party, nonaffiliated, rental income) or
the proceeds of the sale, reﬁnancing, or permanent
ﬁnancing of the property. Include loans secured by
hotels, motels, dormitories, nursing homes, assisted-
living facilities, mini-storage warehouse facilities, and
similar properties in this item as loans secured by other
nonfarm nonresidential properties.
In some instances, it may be appropriate to report loans
secured by nursing homes or assisted-living facilities in
Schedule HC-C, Part I, item 1.e. (1), “Loans secured by
owner-occupied nonfarm nonresidential properties.” The
owner-occupied determination for a loan secured by a
nursing home or an assisted-living facility is based on
whether 50 percent or more of the source of repayment
for the loan comes from the cash ﬂow from the ongoing

Lease ﬁnance receivable.
Holding companies with less than $5 billion should
report in column A, all outstanding balances relating to

Line Item 11
LESS: Any unearned income on
loans reﬂected in items 1–9 above.
To the extent possible, the preferred treatment is to report
the speciﬁc loan categories net of both unearned income
and net unamortized loan fees. A reporting holding
company should enter in columns A and B of this item, as
appropriate, unearned income and net unamortized loan
fees only to the extent that these amounts are included in
(i.e., not deducted from) the various loan items of this
schedule (items 1 through 9).
As deﬁned in Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), “Portfolio Layer
Method” (ASU 2022-01), the portfolio layer method was
added to allow entities to apply hedge accounting to a
closed portfolio of ﬁnancial assets or one or more
beneﬁcial interests secured by a portfolio of ﬁnancial
instruments that is not expected to be affected by prepay-
ments, defaults, or other factors affecting the timing and
amount of cash ﬂows for the designated hedge period.
Under ASU 2022-01, different types of qualifying assets
can be grouped together in a portfolio layer hedge.
Per the standard, an institution should not adjust the
amortized cost basis or the discount rate of the Individual
assets or individual beneﬁcial interest included in the
closed portfolio for a basis adjustment that is maintained
on the closed portfolio basis. As such, an institution that
applies the portfolio method to a closed portfolio of loans
should not allocate the portfolio layer fair value hedge
basis adjustments (FVHBAs) to a more granular level
and should include these unallocated amounts in this
item 11.
If an institution reports each loan item in this schedule
net of both unearned income and net unamortized loan
fees and has no unallocated portfolio layer FVHBAs
applicable to loans, enter a zero in this item. If the
amount to be reported in this item represents an addition
to the amounts reported in Schedule HC-C, Part I, items 1
through 10, because of unallocated portfolio layer FVH-
BAs, report the amount with a minus (-) sign.
Do not include net unamortized direct loan origination
costs in this item; such costs must be added to the related
loan balances reported in Schedule HC-C, items 1
through 9. In addition, do not include unearned income
on lease ﬁnancing receivables in this item. Leases should
be reported net of unearned income in Schedule HC-C,
item 10.
Line Item 12
Total loans and leases, held for
investment and held for sale.
Report in columns A and B, as appropriate, the sum of

rower’s minimum monthly (or other periodic) payment is
contractually permitted to be less than the full amount of
interest owed to the lender, with the unpaid interest added
to the loan’s principal balance. The contractual terms of
the loan provide that if the borrower allows the principal
balance to rise to a pre-speciﬁed amount or maximum
cap, the loan payments are then recast to a fully amortiz-
ing schedule. Negative amortization features may be
applied to either adjustable rate mortgages or ﬁxed rate

otherwise with the intent to resell in order to proﬁt from
short-term price movements, and (c) acquiring or taking
positions in such items as an accommodation to custom-
ers, provided that acquiring or taking such positions
meets the deﬁnition of “trading” in ASC Topic 320,
Investments-Debt Securities, and ASC Topic 815, Deriva-
tives and Hedging, and the deﬁnition of “trading pur-
poses” in ASC Topic 815.
For purposes of the FR Y-9C report, all debt securities
within the scope of ASC Topic 320, Investments – Debt
Securities that a holding company has elected to report at
fair value under a fair value option with changes in fair
value reported in current earnings should be classiﬁed as
trading securities. In addition, for purposes of this report,
holding companies may classify assets (other than debt
securities within the scope of ASC Topic 320) and
liabilities (other than deposit liabilities required to be
reported on Schedule HC-E) as trading if the holding
company applies fair value accounting, with changes in
fair value reported in current earnings, and manages
these assets and liabilities as trading positions, subject to
the controls and applicable regulatory guidance related to
trading activities. For example, a holding company would
generally not classify a loan to which it has applied the
fair value option as a trading asset unless the holding
company holds the loan, which it manages as a trading
position, for one of the following purposes: (a) for market
making activities, including such activities as accumulat-
ing loans for sale or securitization; (b) to beneﬁt from
actual or expected price movements; or (c) to lock in
arbitrage proﬁts. When reporting loans classiﬁed as
trading in Schedule HC-D, holding companies should
include only the fair value of the funded portion of the
loan in item 6 of this schedule. If the unfunded portion of
the loan, if any, is classiﬁed as trading (and does not meet
the deﬁnition of a derivative), the fair value of the
commitment to lend should be reported as an “Other
trading asset” or an “Other trading liability,” as appropri-
ate, in Schedule HC-D, item 9 or item 13(b), respectively.
Assets, liabilities, and other ﬁnancial instruments classi-
ﬁed as trading shall be consistently valued at fair value as
deﬁned by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement.
Exclude from this schedule all available-for-sale securi-
ties and all loans and leases that do not satisfy the criteria
for classiﬁcation as trading as described above. (Also see
the Glossary entry for “Trading Account.”) Available-for-
sale securities are generally reported in Schedule HC,
item 2(b), and in Schedule HC-B, columns C and D.
However, a holding company may have certain assets
that fall within the deﬁnition of “securities” in ASC
Topic 320 (e.g., nonrated industrial development obliga-
tions) that the holding company has designated as
“available-for-sale” which are reported for purposes of
this report in a balance sheet category other than “Secu-
rities” (e.g., “Loans and lease ﬁnancing receivables”).
Loans and leases that do not satisfy the criteria for the
trading account should be reported in Schedule HC, item
4(a) or item 4(b), and in Schedule HC-C.

Schedule HC-E
General Instructions
A complete discussion of deposits is included in the
Glossary entry entitled ‘‘deposits.’’ That discussion
addresses the following topics and types of deposits in
detail:
(1) FDI Act deﬁnition of deposits;
(2) demand deposits;
(3) savings deposits;
(4) time deposits;
(5) time certiﬁcates of deposit;
(6) time deposits, open account;
(7) transaction accounts;
(8) nontransaction accounts;
(9) NOW accounts;
(10) ATS accounts;
(11) telephone or preauthorized transfer accounts;
(12) money market deposit accounts (MMDAs);
(13) interest-bearing accounts; and
(14) noninterest-bearing accounts.
Additional discussions pertaining to deposits are also
found under separate Glossary entries for the following:
(1) borrowings and deposits in foreign offices;
(2) brokered deposits;
(3) dealer reserve accounts;
(4) hypothecated deposits;
(5) letters of credit (for letters of credit sold for cash and
travelers’ letters of credit);
(6) overdrafts;
(7) pass-through reserve balances;
(8) placements and takings; and
(9) reciprocal balances.
NOTE: For purposes of this report, IBFs of subsidiary
depository institutions of the reporting holding company
are to be treated as foreign offices and their deposit
liabilities should be excluded from this schedule.
Deﬁnitions
The term “deposits” is deﬁned in the Glossary and
follows the deﬁnition of deposits used in the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act. Reciprocal demand deposits
between the domestic offices of the reporting holding
company and the domestic offices of other depository
institutions that are not consolidated on this report may
be reported net when permitted by generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). (See the Glossary entry
for ‘‘reciprocal balances.’’)
The following are not reported as deposits:
(1) Deposits received in one office of a depository insti-
tution for deposit in another office of the same
depository institution.
(2) Outstanding drafts (including advices or authoriza-
tions to charge the depository institution’s balance in
another depository institution) drawn in the regular
course of business by the reporting depository insti-
tution on other depository institutions, including
so-called ‘‘suspense depository accounts’’ (report as
a deduction from the related ‘‘due from’’ account).
(3) Trust funds held in the bank’s own trust department
that the bank keeps segregated and apart from its
general assets and does not use in the conduct of its
business.
FR Y-9C
HC-E-1
Schedule HC-E
March 2013

(4) Deposits accumulated for the payment of personal
loans (i.e., hypothecated deposits), which should be
netted against loans in Schedule HC-C, Loans and
Lease Financing Receivables.
(5) All obligations arising from assets sold under agree-
ments to repurchase.
(6) Overdrafts in deposit accounts. Overdrafts are to be
reported as loans in Schedule HC-C, and not as
negative deposits. Overdrafts in a single type of
related transaction accounts (e.g., related demand
deposits or related NOW accounts, but not a combi-
nation of demand deposit accounts and NOW
accounts) of a single legal entity that are established
under a bona ﬁde cash management arrangement
by this legal entity are not to be classiﬁed as loans
unless there is a net overdraft position in the accounts
taken as a whole. Such accounts are regarded as, and
function as, one account rather than as multiple
separate accounts.
(7) Time deposits sold (issued) by a subsidiary bank of
the consolidated holding company that have been
purchased subsequently by a holding company sub-
sidiary in the secondary market (typically as a result
of the holding company’s trading activities) and have
not resold as of the report date. For purposes of these
reports, a holding company (or its subsidiaries) that
purchases a time deposit a subsidiary has issued is
regarded as having paid the time deposit prior to
maturity. The effect of the transaction is that the
consolidated holding company has cancelled a liabil-
ity as opposed to having acquired an asset for its
portfolio.
(8) Cash payments received in connection with transfers
of the holding company’s other real estate owned that
have been ﬁnanced by the holding company and do
not qualify for sale accounting, which applicable
accounting standards describe as a “liability,” a
“deposit,” or a “deposit liability.” Until a transfer
qualiﬁes for sale accounting, these cash payments
shall be reported in Schedule HC-G, item 4, “All
other liabilities.” See the Glossary entry for “fore-
closed assets” for further information.
The following are reported as deposits:
(1) Deposits of trust funds standing to the credit of
other banks and all trust funds held or deposited in
any department of a subsidiary depository institu-
tion of the reporting holding company other than
the trust department.
(2) Escrow funds.
(3) Payments collected by a depository institution sub-
sidiary on loans secured by real estate and other
loans serviced for others that have not yet been
remitted to the owners of the loans.
(4) Credit balances resulting from customers’ overpay-
ments of account balances on credit cards and
related plans.
(5) Funds received or held in connection with checks
or drafts drawn by a subsidiary depository institu-
tion of the reporting holding company and drawn
on, or payable at or through, another depository
institution either on a zero-balance account or on an
account that is not routinely maintained with suffi-
cient balances to cover checks drawn in the normal
course of business (including accounts where funds
are remitted by a subsidiary depository institution
of the reporting holding company only when it has
been advised that the checks or drafts have been
presented).
(6) Funds received or held in connection with travel-
er’s checks and money orders sold (but not drawn)
by a subsidiary depository institution of the report-
ing holding company, until the proceeds of the sale
are remitted to another party, and funds received or
held in connection with other such checks used (but
not drawn) by a subsidiary depository institution of
the reporting holding company, until the amount of
the checks is remitted to another party.
(7) Checks drawn by a subsidiary depository institution
of the reporting holding company on, or payable at
or through, a Federal Reserve Bank or a Federal
Home Loan Bank.
(8) Refundable loan commitment fees received or held
by a subsidiary depository institution of the report-
ing holding company prior to loan closing.
(9) Refundable stock subscription payments received
or held by the reporting holding company prior to
the issuance of the stock. (Report nonrefundable
stock subscription payments in Schedule HC-G,
item 4, ‘‘Other’’ liabilities.)
(10) Improperly executed repurchase agreement sweep
accounts (repo sweeps). According to Section 360.8
Schedule HC-E
HC-E-2
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-E
September 2018

of the FDIC’s regulations, an ‘‘internal sweep
account’’ is ‘‘an account held pursuant to a contract
between an insured depository institution and its
customer involving the pre-arranged, automated
transfer of funds from a deposit account to . . .
another account or investment vehicle located
within the depository institution.’’ When a repo
sweep from a deposit account is improperly executed
by an institution, the customer obtains neither an
ownership interest in identiﬁed assets subject to a
repurchase agreement nor a perfected security inter-
est in the applicable assets. In this situation, the
institution should report the swept funds as deposit
liabilities, not as repurchase agreements, beginning
July 1, 2009.
(11) The unpaid balance of money received or held by
the reporting institution that the reporting institu-
tion promises to pay pursuant to an instruction
received through the use of a card, or other pay-
ment code or access device, issued on a prepaid or
prefunded basis.
In addition, the gross amount of debit items (‘‘throw-
outs,’’ ‘‘bookkeepers’ cutbacks,’’ or ‘‘rejects’’) that can-
not be posted to the individual deposit accounts without
creating overdrafts or for some other reason, but which
have been charged to the control accounts of the various
deposit categories on the general ledger, should be cred-
ited to (added back to) the appropriate deposit control
totals and reported in Schedule HC, item 11, ‘‘Other
assets.’’
The distinction between transaction and nontransaction
accounts is discussed in detail in the Glossary entry for
“deposits.”
NOTE: Deposits deﬁned in Regulation D as transaction
accounts include demand deposits, NOW accounts, tele-
phone and preauthorized transfer accounts, and savings
deposits. However, for Call Report purposes, savings
deposits are classiﬁed as a type of nontransaction account.
For institutions that have suspended the six transfer limit
on an account that meets the deﬁnition of a savings
deposit, please see the “Treatment of Accounts where
Reporting Institutions Have Suspended Enforcement of
the Six Transfer Limit per Regulation D” in the Glossary
entry for “deposits” for further details on reporting
savings deposits.
Line Item 1

commercial bank subsidiaries of the reporting
holding company.
Report in items 1(a) through 1(e) below deposits held

For purposes of this item, commercial bank subsidiaries
cover all banks that ﬁle the commercial bank Consoli-
dated Reports of Condition and Income (FFIEC 031,
041). See the Glossary entry for ‘‘Domestic Office’’ for
the deﬁnition of this term.
If the reporting holding company consolidates a subsidi-
ary foreign bank on this report, items 1(a) through 1(e)
must also include deposits held in the U.S. offices of such
foreign bank subsidiaries.

reporting holding company by any of its duly autho-
rized officers and that are outstanding on the report
date.
(4) Outstanding travelers’ checks, travelers’ letters of

(6) Checks or drafts drawn by, or on behalf of, a
non-U.S. office of a subsidiary bank of the reporting
holding company on an account maintained at a U.S.

Exclude from this item interest-only strips receivable in
the form of a security, which should be reported as
available-for-sale securities in Schedule HC, item 2(b),
or as trading assets in Schedule HC, item 5, as appropri-
ate. Also exclude interest-only strips not in the form of
a security that are held for trading, which should be
reported in Schedule HC, item 5.
Line Item 4
Equity investments without readily
determinable fair values.
Report the reporting holding company’s equity securities
and other equity investments without readily determin-
able fair values that are not reportable in other items on

strip does not meet the deﬁnition of a security in ASC Topic 320,
Investments-Debt and Equity Securities.
FR Y-9C
HC-F-1
Schedule HC-F
March 2024

the FR Y-9C report balance sheet (Schedule HC). An
equity security does not have a readily determinable fair
value if sales prices or bid-and-asked quotations are not
currently available on a securities exchange registered
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) or are not publicly reported by the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations
systems or by OTC Markets Group Inc. The fair value of
an equity security traded only in a foreign market is not
readily determinable if that foreign market is not of a
breadth and scope comparable to one of the U.S. markets
referred to above.
Equity investments that do not have readily determinable
fair values may have been purchased by the reporting
holding company or acquired for debts previously con-
tracted.
All holding companies should report equity securities
and other equity investments without readily determin-
able fair values at (i) fair value or (ii) if chosen by the
reporting holding company for an individual equity
investment that does not have a readily determinable fair
value, at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in
orderly transactions for the identical or a similar invest-
ment of the same issuer. These equity securities are
within the scope of ASC Topic 321, Investments-Equity
Securities, or ASC Topic 323, Investments-Equity Method
and Joint Ventures.
Although Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home
Loan Bank stock do not have readily determinable fair
values, they are outside the scope of ASC Topics 321 and
323. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 942-325, Finan-
cial Services-Depository and Lending – Investments-
Other, Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home
Loan Bank stock are carried at cost and evaluated for
impairment.
Include in this item:
(1) Federal Reserve Bank stock.
(2) Common and preferred stocks that do not have
readily determinable fair values, such as stock of
bankers’ banks and Class B voting common stock of
the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
(Farmer Mac).
(3) Federal Home Loan Bank stock.
(4) “Restricted stock,” as deﬁned in ASC Topic 320, i.e.,
equity securities for which sale is restricted by
governmental or contractual requirement (other than
in connection with being pledged as collateral),
except if that requirement terminates within one year
or if the holder has the power by contract or other-
wise to cause the requirement to be met within one
year.
(5) Participation certiﬁcates issued by a Federal Interme-
diate Credit Bank, which represent nonvoting stock
of the bank.
(6) Minority interests held by the reporting holding
company in any company not meeting the deﬁnition
of associated company, except minority holdings that
indirectly represent premises of the holding company
(report in Schedule HC, item 6), other real estate
owned (report in Schedule HC, item 7), or invest-
ments in real estate ventures (report in Schedule HC,
item 9), provided that the fair value of any capital
stock representing the minority interest is not readily
determinable. (See the Glossary entry for ‘‘subsidi-
aries’’ for the deﬁnition of associated company.)
(7) Equity holdings in those corporate ventures over
which the reporting bank does not exercise signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence, except equity holdings that indirectly
represent premises of the holding company (report in
Schedule HC, item 6), other real estate owned (report
in Schedule HC, item 7), or investments in real estate
ventures (report in Schedule HC, item 9). (See the
Glossary entry for ‘‘subsidiaries’’ for the deﬁnition of
corporate joint venture.)
Exclude from this item:
(1) Investments in subsidiaries that have not been con-
solidated; associated companies; corporate joint ven-
tures, unincorporated joint ventures, and general
partnerships over which the holding company exer-
cises signiﬁcant inﬂuence; and noncontrolling invest-
ments in certain limited partnerships and limited
liability companies (described in the Glossary entry
for ‘‘equity method of accounting’’) (report in Sched-
ule HC, item 8, ‘‘Investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries and associated companies,’’ or item 9,

Line Item 5
Life insurance assets.
Report in the appropriate subitem the amount of the
holding company’s general account, separate account,
and hybrid account holdings of life insurance that could
be realized under the insurance contracts as of the report
date. In general, this amount is the cash surrender value
reported to the holding company by the insurance carrier,
less any applicable surrender charges not reﬂected by the
carrier in the reported cash surrender value, on all forms
of permanent life insurance policies owned by the hold-
ing company, its consolidated subsidiaries, and grantor
(rabbi) trusts established by the holding company or its
consolidated subsidiaries, regardless of the purposes for
acquiring the insurance. A holding company should also
consider any additional amounts included in the contrac-
tual terms of the insurance policy in determining the
amount that could be realized under the insurance con-
tract. For further information, see the Glossary entry for
‘‘bank-owned life insurance.’’
Permanent life insurance refers to whole and universal
life insurance, including variable universal life insurance.
Purposes for which insurance may be acquired include
offsetting pre- and post-retirement costs for employee
compensation and beneﬁt plans, protecting against the
loss of key persons, and providing retirement and death
beneﬁts to employees.
Include as life insurance assets the holding company’s
interest in insurance policies under split-dollar life insur-
ance arrangements with directors, officers, and employ-
ees under both the endorsement and collateral assignment
methods.
Line Item 5(a)
General account life insurance
assets.
Report the amount of the holding company’s holdings of
life insurance assets associated with general account
insurance policies. In a general account life insurance
policy, the general assets of the insurance company
issuing the policy support the policy’s cash surrender
value.
Also include the portion of the carrying value of:
(1) Separate account policies that represents general
account claims on the insurance company, such as
realizable deferred acquisition costs and mortality
reserves; and
(2) Hybrid account policies that represents general
account claims on the insurance company, such as
any shortfall in the value of the separate account
assets supporting the cash surrender value of the
policies.
Line Item 5(b)
Separate account life insurance
assets.
Report the amount of the holding company’s holdings of
life insurance assets associated with separate account
insurance policies. In a separate account policy, the
policy’s cash surrender value is supported by assets
segregated from the general assets of the insurance
carrier. Under such an arrangement, the policyholder
neither owns the underlying separate account created by
the insurance carrier on its behalf nor controls investment
decisions in the underlying account, but does assume all
investment and price risk.
Separate accounts are employed by life insurers to meet
speciﬁc investment objectives of policyholders. The
accounts are often maintained as separate accounting and
reporting entities for pension plans as well as ﬁxed
beneﬁt, variable annuity, and other products. Investment
income and investment gains and losses generally accrue
directly to such policyholders and are not accounted for
on the general accounts of the insurer. On the books of
the insurer, the carrying values of separate account assets
and liabilities usually approximate each other with little
associated capital. Because they are legally segregated,
the assets of each separate account are not subject to
claims on the insurer that arise out of any other business
of the insurance company.
Line Item 5(c)
Hybrid account life insurance
assets.
Report the amount of the holding company’s holdings of
life insurance assets associated with hybrid account
insurance policies. A hybrid account insurance policy
combines features of both general and separate account
insurance products. Similar to a general account life
insurance policy, a hybrid policy offers a guaranteed
minimum crediting rate, does not carry market value risk,
and does not require stable value protection. However,
Schedule HC-F
FR Y-9C
HC-F-3
Schedule HC-F
March 2013

like a separate account life insurance policy, a hybrid
policy’s cash surrender value is supported by assets
segregated from the general assets of the insurance
carrier. Because they are legally segregated, the assets of
each separate account are not subject to claims on the
insurer that arise out of any other business of the
insurance company. Additionally, the holding company
holding the hybrid account life insurance policy is able to
select the investment strategy in which the insurance
premiums are invested. Under such an arrangement, the
policyholder neither owns the underlying separate account
created by the insurance carrier on its behalf nor controls
investment decisions in the underlying account.
Line Item 6
Other.
Report the amount of all other assets (other than those
reported in Schedule HC-F, items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 above)
which cannot properly be reported in Schedule HC,
items 1 through 10.
Report ﬁnancial assets included within this line item net
of any applicable allowances for credit losses.
Include as all other assets:
(1) Prepaid expenses i.e., those applicable as a charge
against earnings in future periods.
(2) Cost of issuing subordinated notes and debentures
and the cost of issuing notes payable to unconsoli-
dated special purpose entities that issue trust pre-
ferred securities, net of accumulated amortization.
(3) Automobiles, boats, equipment, appliances, and
similar personal property repossessed or otherwise
acquired for debts previously contracted.
(4) Derivative instruments that have a positive fair
value that the holding company holds for purposes
other than trading. For further information, see
Glossary entry for ‘‘derivative contracts.’’
(5) Accrued interest on securities purchased (if
accounted for separately from ‘‘accrued interest
receivable’’ in the holding company’s records).
(6) Cash items not conforming to the deﬁnition of
‘‘Cash items in process of collection’’ found in the
instruction to Schedule HC, item 1(a).
(7) Credit or debit card sales slips in process of collec-
tion until the reporting holding company has been
notiﬁed that it has been given credit (report thereaf-
ter in Schedule HC, item 1(a), ‘‘Noninterest-bearing
balances and currency and coin’’).
(8) Purchased computer software, net of accumulated
amortization, and unamortized costs of computer
software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed
capitalized in accordance with the provisions of
ASC Subtopic 985-20, Software – Costs of Soft-
ware to Be Sold, Leased or Marketed.
(9) Bullion (e.g., gold or silver) not held for trading
purposes.
(10) Original art objects, including paintings, antique
objects, and similar valuable decorative articles
(report at cost unless there has been a decline in
value, judged to be other than temporary, in which
case the object should be written down to its fair
value).
(11) Securities or other assets held in charitable trusts
(e.g., Clifford Trusts).
(12) The full amount (with the exceptions noted below)
of customers’ liability to the reporting holding
company on drafts and bills of exchange that have
been accepted by the reporting holding company, or
by others for its account, and are outstanding. The
amount of customers’ liability to the reporting
holding company on its acceptances that have not
yet matured should be reduced only when: (a) the
customer anticipates its liability to the reporting
holding company on an outstanding acceptance by
making a payment to the holding company in
advance of the acceptance’s maturity that immedi-
ately reduces the customer’s indebtedness to the
holding company on such an acceptance; or (b) the
reporting holding company acquires and holds its
own acceptance. See the Glossary entry for ‘‘bank-
ers acceptances’’ for further information.
(13) Debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrange-
ments, net of accumulated amortization. Debt issu-
ance costs related to a recognized debt liability that
is not a line-of-credit arrangement should be pre-
sented as a direct deduction from the face amount
of the related debt, not as an asset. For debt
reported at fair value under a fair value option, debt
issuance costs should be expensed as incurred.
(14) Furniture and equipment rented to others under
operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation.

(19) The positive fair value of unused loan commit-
ments (not accounted for as derivatives) that the
holding company has elected to report at fair value
under a fair value option.
(20) Retained interests in accrued interest receivable
related to securitized credit cards. For further infor-
mation, see the Glossary entry for ‘‘accrued interest
receivable related to credit card securitizations.’’
(21) Indemniﬁcation assets arising from loss-sharing
agreements with the FDIC covering speciﬁed assets
acquired from failed insured depository institutions
or otherwise purchased from the FDIC. (Exclude
the assets covered by FDIC loss-sharing agree-
ments from this component of ‘‘Other’’ assets.
Report each covered asset in the balance sheet
category appropriated to the asset on Schedule HC,
e.g., report covered held-for-investment loans in
Schedule HC, item 4(b), ‘‘Loans and leases, held
for investment.’’)
(22) Receivables arising from foreclosures on fully and
partially government-guaranteed mortgage loans if
the guarantee is not separable from the loan before
foreclosure and, at the time of foreclosure, (a) the
institution’s intent is to convey the property to the
guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee and
the holding company has the ability to recover
under that claim, and (b) any amount of the claim
that is determined on the basis of the fair value of
the real estate is ﬁxed. For further information, see
the Glossary entry for “Foreclosed assets.”
Exclude from all other assets:
(1) Redeemed U.S. savings bonds and food stamps
(report in Schedule HC, item 1(a), ‘‘Noninterest-
bearing balances and currency and coin’’).
(2) Real estate owned or leasehold improvements to
property intended for future use as premises of the
holding company (report in Schedule HC, item 6,
‘‘Premises and ﬁxed assets’’).
(3) Accounts identiﬁed as ‘‘building accounts,’’ ‘‘con-
struction accounts,’’ or ‘‘remodeling accounts’’ (report
in Schedule HC, item 6, ‘‘Premises and ﬁxed assets’’).
(4) Real estate acquired in any manner for debts previ-
ously contracted (including, but not limited to, real
estate acquired through foreclosure and real estate
acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure), even if the
holding company has not yet received title to the
property, and real estate collateral underlying a loan
when the holding company has obtained physical
possession of the collateral (report as ‘‘All other real
estate owned’’ in Schedule HC-M, item 13(b)).

LINE INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Interest Sensitivity
Schedule HC-H
General Instructions
Schedule HC-H requests information related to interest
rate sensitivity.
Information for only selected assets and liabilities is
requested in this schedule. The schedule does not pro-
vide, nor is it intended to provide, a comprehensive view
of the interest rate sensitivity position of the reporting
holding company.
The information reported on this schedule must be
consolidated on the same basis as the rest of the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements for Holding Companies.
However, holding companies that have foreign subsidi-
aries or subsidiaries with more than one office in foreign
countries (including offices of consolidated foreign sub-
sidiaries but excluding ‘‘shell’’ branches, excluding
offices in Puerto Rico or U.S. territories and possessions,
and excluding IBFs) have the option of excluding the
smallest of such non-U.S. offices from coverage in this
schedule. Such holding companies may exclude the
smallest of their offices in foreign countries (other than
‘‘shell’’ branches) when arrayed by total assets provided
that the assets of the excluded offices do not exceed
50 percent of the total assets of the holding company’s
offices (excluding ‘‘shells’’) in foreign countries and do
not exceed 10 percent of the total consolidated assets of
the reporting holding company as of the report date.
(Note: In determining the total assets of offices in foreign
countries eligible for exclusion from this schedule, hold-
ing companies should exclude not only ‘‘shell’’ branches
but also offices in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and
possessions, domestic offices of Edge and Agreement
subsidiaries, and IBFs even though these are sometimes
referred to as ‘‘foreign’’ offices. Also, the asset totals for
all offices in foreign countries should be the component
of the total consolidated assets, i.e., should exclude all
intracompany transactions.)
The assets and liabilities included in this schedule should
be reported without regard to the instruments’ repayment
schedules, by remaining maturity for transactions with
ﬁxed or predetermined rates, and by repricing frequency
for transactions with ﬂoating or adjustable rates. (See
deﬁnitions of terms below.)
Alternatively, the holding company may, at its option:
(1) continue to report its ﬂoating rate transactions by
the earliest repricing opportunity if its records pro-
vide repricing data on the length of time between the
report date and the date the rate can next change; and
(2) continue to report its multipayment transactions on
the basis of the scheduled contractual payments if its
records provide repricing data on the basis of these
scheduled contractual payments.
However,
the
reporting
holding
company
must
apply either the ﬁrst procedure in reporting this schedule
or the alternate procedure but it must apply one proce-
dure consistently for every transaction reported on this
schedule.
Deﬁnitions
A ﬁxed interest rate is a rate that is speciﬁed at the
origination of the transaction, is ﬁxed and invariable
during the term of the instrument, and is known to both
the borrower and the lender.
A predetermined interest rate is a rate that changes
during the term of the instrument on a predetermined
basis, with the exact rate of interest over the life of the
instrument known with certainty to both the borrower
and the lender when the instrument is acquired. Examples
of predetermined-rate transactions are as follows:
(1) Loans that carry a speciﬁed interest rate, for, say, six
months and thereafter carry a rate equal to a speciﬁc
percentage over the initial rate.
(2) Loans that carry a speciﬁed interest rate while the
loan amount is below a certain threshold amount but
FR Y-9C
HC-H-1
Schedule HC-H
March 2013

carry a different speciﬁed rate above that threshold
(e.g., a line of credit where the interest rate is 14%
when the unpaid balance of amounts advanced is
$100,000 or less, and 12% when the unpaid balance
is more than $100,000).
A ﬂoating or adjustable interest rate is a rate that varies,
or can vary, in relation to an index, to some other interest
rate, such as the rate on certain U.S. government securi-
ties or the bank’s ‘‘prime rate,’’ or to some other variable
criterion the exact value of which cannot be known in
advance. Therefore, the exact rate the instrument carries
at any subsequent time cannot be known at the time of
origination. If the interest rate can ﬂoat or be adjusted
daily, the rate is considered immediately adjustable, even
if the rate is not, in fact, changed.
For purposes of this schedule, when the rate on an
instrument with a ﬂoating or adjustable rate can no longer
ﬂoat because it has reached a ﬂoor or ceiling level, the
instrument is to be treated as ‘‘ﬁxed rate’’ rather than as
‘‘ﬂoating rate’’ until the rate is again free to ﬂoat.
Remaining maturity is the amount of time remaining
from the report date until the ﬁnal contractual maturity of
the instrument without regard to the instruments repay-
ment schedule, if any.
Repricing frequency is how often the contract permits the
interest rate on an instrument to be changed (e.g., daily,
monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually) without regard
to the length of time between the report date and the date
the rate can next change.
Line Item 1
Earning assets that are repriceable
within one year or mature within one year.
Report all assets that the consolidated holding company
considers earning assets that have a remaining maturity
of less than one year or where the repricing frequency is
less than one year.
Earning assets generally include interest-bearing bal-
ances due from depository institutions, securities, federal
funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to
resell, and loans and leases. Assets in these categories
that are in nonaccrual status should be excluded from
earning assets.
Exclude trading account assets and equity securities.
Report in this item the following:
(1) Earning assets that have a ﬁxed or predetermined
interest rate and that have a remaining maturity of
less than one year.
Note, however, holding companies with multipay-
ment ﬁxed rate earning assets may continue to report
the dollar amount of scheduled contractual payments
that are to be repaid in less than one year in this item
even though the remaining maturity of the assets is
one year or more provided all multipayment transac-
tions are reported in this manner. (See general
instructions for this schedule.)
(2) Earning assets that have a ﬂoating or variable rate
contract that permits the interest rate on the asset to
change more often than once a year, i.e., has a
repricing frequency of less than one year (even
though the remaining maturity on the assets may be
one year or more).
Note, however, holding companies whose records
provide repricing data on the length of time between
the report date and the date the rate can next change
(i.e., by earliest repricing opportunity) may continue
to report in this item the dollar amount of ﬂoating
rate earning assets with an earliest repricing opportu-
nity of less than one year, even though the repricing
frequency is one year or more, provided all ﬂoating
rate transactions are reported on this schedule in this
manner. If a holding company chooses to report its
ﬂoating rate earning assets by the earliest repricing
opportunity, it should report in this item the dollar
amount of the contractual payments on its multipay-
ment ﬂoating rate earning assets that are scheduled to
be repaid within one year even if the earliest repric-
ing opportunity and the repricing frequency is one
year or more. (See general instructions for this
schedule.)
Included in this item, if the repricing frequency or
remaining maturity are less than one year, are the
following:
(1) Leases,
held
for
investment,
as
ﬁxed
rate
instruments.
Note, however, holding companies may continue to
report the change in the book value of the lease
payments that are to be repaid in less than one year,
net of unearned income provided they are reporting
on this schedule using the alternate procedure
Schedule HC-H
HC-H-2
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-H

described in the general instructions to this sched-
ule. Any estimated residual value included in the
net book value should be reported if the ﬁnal lease
payment is scheduled to be made in less than one
year.
(2) All demand loans made solely on a demand basis
(i.e., without an alternate maturity date or without
repayment terms).
(3) Demand loans that have an alternate maturity date
or repayment terms, as ﬁxed or ﬂoating rate instru-
ments, on the basis of the alternate maturity date.
(4) Credit cards and related plans with ﬂoating or
adjustable rates (e.g., where the rate varies, or can
vary, each billing cycle). Where the holding com-
pany in its contract with the borrower simply
reserves the right to change the interest rate on a
credit card or related plan, the plan should not be
considered to have a ﬂoating or adjustable rate.
Credit cards and related plans with ﬁxed or prede-
termined rates are to be excluded from this item.
(5) Amortizing ﬁxed rate mortgage loans that implic-
itly permit rate adjustments by having the note
mature at the end of an interval shorter than the
term of the amortization schedule unless the hold-
ing company made no promise to reﬁnance the
loan, as a ﬂoating rate instrument.
(6) Student loans whose interest rate is adjusted peri-
odically by the U.S. government by means of
interest payments that include an amount of ‘‘addi-
tional interest,’’ as ﬂoating rate instruments.
(7) Loans secured by real estate that are held by the
holding company or its subsidiaries for sale and
delivery to the Federal National Mortgage Associa-
tion or other secondary market participants under
the terms of a binding commitment, on the basis of
the delivery date speciﬁed in the commitment.
(8) Floating rate loans on which the borrower has the
option at each repricing date to choose the next
repricing date, in accordance with the repricing
option currently in effect as of the report date.
(9) Debt securities, without regard to their call date
unless the security has actually been called. When
ﬁxed rate debt securities have been called, they
should be reported on the basis of the time remain-
ing until the call date.
(10) Mortgage pass-through certiﬁcates (such as those
issued by the Government National Mortgage
Association (GNMA), the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), certain banks
and savings and loan associations, and securities
dealers) and all Small Business Administration
(SBA) ‘‘Guaranteed Loan Pool Certiﬁcates.’’
(11) Fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations
(CMOs) and similar instruments on the basis of the
time remaining until the stated ﬁnal maturity of the
instrument, not the projected ﬁnal maturity or
weighted average life of the instrument.
(12) Debt securities that provide the consolidated hold-
ing company with the option to redeem them at one
or more speciﬁed dates prior to their contractual
maturity date, so-called ‘‘put bonds,’’ on the basis
of earliest ‘‘put’’ date for bonds.
(13) Zero coupon debt securities, as ﬁxed rate debt
securities.
Line Item 2
Interest-bearing deposit liabilities that
reprice within one year or mature within one year.
Report in this item all interest-bearing deposit liabilities
that have a time remaining to maturity of less than one
year and any other interest-bearing deposit liabilities that
have a repricing frequency of less than one year (regard-
less of the remaining maturity), without regard to sched-
uled contractual payments on deposits with multiple
maturities. The amount reported in this item should
be included in Schedule HC, item 13(a)(2), ‘‘Interest-
bearing deposits in domestic offices,’’ and item 13(b)(2),
‘‘Interest-bearing deposits in foreign offices, Edge and
agreement subsidiaries, and IBFs.’’
Do not report deposits in domestic offices classiﬁed as
demand or savings accounts (including money market
deposit accounts and all NOW accounts).
Note, however, holding companies choosing to continue
to report their multi-maturity deposits on the basis of
their scheduled contractual payments and their ﬂoating
rate deposits by earliest repricing opportunity should
report in this item the following:
(1) the dollar amount of ﬂoating or variable rate deposits
that can be repriced in less than one year even if few,
Schedule HC-H

if any, of the contractual payments are scheduled to
be repaid within one year. If the deposits have

(2) the dollar amount of the scheduled contractual pay-
ments that are to be repaid in less than one year if the

(3) Subordinated notes and debentures reported in Sched-
ule HC, item 19(a) (excluding limited-life preferred

than one payment on the basis of their scheduled contrac-
tual payments and their ﬂoating rate long-term debt by
earliest repricing opportunity should report the following
in this item:
(1) the dollar amount of ﬂoating or variable rate long-
term debt that can be repriced in less than one year
even if few, if any, of the contractual payments are
scheduled to be repaid within one year. If the multi-
payment debt has some contractual payments sched-
uled to be repaid within one year, but cannot be
repriced for one year or more, include the dollar
amount of the contractual payments to be repaid
within one year. (See general instructions for this
schedule.)
(2) the dollar amount of the scheduled contractual pay-
ments that are to be repaid in less than one year if the
long-term debt has ﬁxed or predetermined rates. (See

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Quarterly Averages
Schedule HC-K
General Instructions
Report for the items on this schedule the average of the
balances as of the close of business for each day for the
calendar quarter or an average of the balances as of the
close of business on each Wednesday during the calendar
quarter. For days that the holding company (or any of its
consolidated subsidiaries or branches) is closed (e.g.,
Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays), use the amount out-
standing from the previous business day. An office is
considered closed if there are no transactions posted to
the general ledger as of that date.
Insurance SLHCs that are completing Schedule HC-K
and do not calculate quarterly averages as prescribed by
these instructions may calculate the quarterly averages
utilizing an industry convention or may provide estimates
on a best efforts basis utilizing one of the two quarterly
average calculations prescribed in these instructions.
Disclose the method used to calculate quarterly averages
in the ‘‘Notes to the Balance Sheet - Other’’ section.
If the reporting holding company was the acquirer in a
business combination accounted for under the acquisition
method for which the acquisition date was during the
calendar quarter, the quarterly averages for the holding
company should include in the numerator:
• Dollar amounts for the reporting holding company for
each day (or each Wednesday) from the beginning of
the quarter until the acquisition date and
• Dollar amounts for the reporting holding company and
the acquired business for each day (or each Wednes-
day) from the acquisition date through the end of the
quarter
and should include in the denominator the number of
days (or Wednesdays) in the entire quarter.
If the reporting holding company was involved in a
transaction between entities under common control that
became effective during the calendar quarter and has
been accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar
to a pooling of interests, the quarterly averages for the
holding company should include dollar amounts for both
the reporting holding company and the business that was
combined in the transaction for each day (or each
Wednesday) from the beginning to the end of the quarter
in the numerator and the number of days (or Wednes-
days) in the entire quarter in the denominator. For further
information
on
business
combinations,
pushdown
accounting, and transactions between entities under com-
mon control, see the Glossary entry for “Business Com-
binations.”
If the holding company began operating during the
calendar quarter, the quarterly averages for the holding
company should include only the dollar amounts for the
days (or Wednesdays) since the holding company began
operating in the numerator and the number of days (or
Wednesdays) since the holding company began operating
in the denominator.
Holding companies should not deduct allowances for
credit losses, if any, from the related amortized cost
amounts when calculating quarterly averages for items
for Schedule HC-K, items 1 through 4. However, holding
companies should deduct allowances for credit losses
from the related amortized cost amounts when calculat-
ing the quarterly average for total consolidated assets for
Schedule HC-K, item 5.

General Instructions
Report on a fully consolidated basis the following
selected commitments, contingencies, and other off-

gencies arising in connection with litigation. For those
asset-backed commercial paper program conduits that the
reporting holding company consolidates onto its balance
sheet (Schedule HC) in accordance with ASC Subtopic

pretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, as amended by FASB Statement No. 167,
Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)), any
credit enhancements and liquidity facilities the holding
company provides to the programs should not be reported
in Schedule HC-L. In contrast, for conduits that the
reporting holding company does not consolidate, the
holding company should report the credit enhancements
and liquidity facilities it provides to the programs in the
appropriate items of Schedule HC-L.
Line Item 1
Unused commitments.
Report in the appropriate subitem the unused portions of
commitments. Unused commitments are to be reported
gross, i.e., include in the appropriate subitem the unused
amount of commitments acquired from and conveyed or
participated to others. However, exclude commitments
conveyed or participated to others that the holding com-
pany is not legally obligated to fund even if the party to
whom the commitment has been conveyed or partici-
pated fails to perform in accordance with the terms of the
commitment.
For purposes of this item, commitments include:
(1) Commitments to make or purchase extensions of
credit in the form of loans or participations in loans,
lease ﬁnancing receivables, or similar transactions.
(2) Commitments for which the holding company has
charged a commitment fee or other consideration.
(3) Commitments that are legally binding.
(4) Loan proceeds that the holding company is obligated
to advance, such as:
(a) Loan draws;
(b) Construction progress payments; and
(c) Seasonal or living advances to farmers under
prearranged lines of credit.
(5) Rotating, revolving, and open-end credit arrange-
ments, including, but not limited to, retail credit card
lines and home equity lines of credit.
(6) Commitments to issue a commitment at some point
in the future, where the holding company has extended
terms, the borrower has accepted the offered terms,
and the extension and acceptance of the terms:
(a) Are in writing, regardless of whether they are
legally binding on the holding company and the
borrower, or
(b) If not in writing, are legally binding on the
holding company and the borrower,1
even though the related loan agreement has not yet
been signed and even if the commitment to issue a
commitment is revocable, provided any revocation
has not yet taken effect as of the report date.
(7) Overdraft protection on depositors’ accounts offered
under a program where the holding company advises
account holders of the available amount of overdraft
1. For example, either the extension or the acceptance of the terms or
both are verbal, but they are nonetheless legally binding on both parties
under applicable law.
FR Y-9C
HC-L-1
Schedule HC-L

protection, for example, when accounts are opened or
on depositors’ account statements or ATM receipts.
(8) The holding company’s own takedown in securities
underwriting transactions.
(9) Revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs), note issu-
ance facilities (NIFs), and other similar arrange-
ments, which are facilities under which a borrower
can issue on a revolving basis short-term paper in its
own name, but for which the underwriting holding
company has a legally binding commitment either to
purchase any notes the borrower is unable to sell by
the rollover date or to advance funds to the borrower.
Exclude forward contracts and other commitments that
meet the deﬁnition of a derivative and must be
accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging (formerly Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended), which should be reported in
Schedule HC-L, item 13. Include the amount (not the
fair value) of the unused portions of loan commitments
that do not meet the deﬁnition of a derivative that the
holding company has elected to report at fair value
under
a
fair
value
option.
Also
include
forward
contracts
that
do
not
meet
the
deﬁnition
of
a
derivative.
The unused portions of commitments are to be reported
in the appropriate subitem regardless of whether they
contain ‘‘material adverse change’’ clauses or other pro-
visions that are intended to relieve the issuer of its
funding obligations under certain conditions and regard-
less of whether they are unconditionally cancelable at
any time.
In the case of commitments for syndicated loans, report
only the holding company’s proportional share of the
commitment.
For purposes of reporting the unused portions of revolv-
ing asset-based lending commitments, the commitment is
deﬁned as the amount a holding company is obligated to
fund — as of the report date — based on the contractu-
ally agreed upon terms. In the case of revolving asset-
based lending, the unused portions of such commitments
should be measured as the difference between (a) the
lesser of the contractual borrowing base (i.e., eligible
collateral times the advance rate) or the note commitment
limit, and (b) the sum of outstanding loans and letters of
credit under the commitment. The note commitment limit
is the overall maximum loan amount beyond which the
holding company will not advance funds regardless of
the amount of collateral posted. This deﬁnition of ‘‘com-
mitment’’ is applicable only to revolving asset-based
lending, which is a specialized form of secured lending in
which a borrower uses current assets (e.g., accounts
receivable and inventory) as collateral for a loan. The
loan is structured so that the amount of credit is limited
by the value of the collateral.
Line Item 1(a)
Revolving, open-end loans secured
by 1–4 family residential properties, e.g., home
equity lines.
Report the unused portion of commitments to extend

Line Items 2 and 3
General Instructions for
Standby Letters of Credit.
Originating holding companies (or their subsidiaries)
must report in items 2 and 3 the full amount outstanding
and unused of ﬁnancial and performance standby letters
of credit, respectively. Include those standby letters of
credit that are collateralized by cash on deposit, that have
been acquired from others, and in which participations
have been conveyed to others where (a) the originating
and issuing holding company is obligated to pay the full
amount of any draft drawn under the terms of the standby
letter of credit and (b) the participating institutions have
an obligation to partially or wholly reimburse the origi-
nating holding company, either directly in cash or through
a participation in a loan to the account party.
For syndicated standby letters of credit where each
holding company has a direct obligation to the beneﬁ-
ciary, each institution must report only its share in the
syndication. Similarly, if several organizations partici-
pate in the issuance of a standby letter of credit under a
bona ﬁde binding agreement that provides that (a) regard-
less of any event, each participant shall be liable only up
to a certain percentage or to a certain amount and (b) the
beneﬁciary is advised and has agreed that each participat-
ing organization is only liable for a certain portion of the
entire amount, each holding company shall report only its
proportional share of the total standby letter of credit.
For a ﬁnancial or performance standby letter of credit
that is in turn backed by a ﬁnancial standby letter of
credit issued by another institution, each holding com-
pany must report the entire amount of the standby letter
of credit it has issued in either item 2 or 3 below, as
appropriate. The amount of the reporting holding com-
pany’s ﬁnancial or performance standby letter of credit
that is backed by the other institution’s ﬁnancial standby
letter of credit must be included in either item 2(a) or 3(a)
as appropriate, since the backing of standby letters of
credit has substantially the same effect as the conveying
of participations in standby letters of credit.
Also, include all ﬁnancial and performance guarantees
issued by foreign offices of the reporting holding com-
pany pursuant to Section 211.4(a)(1) of Federal Reserve
Schedule HC-L

Line Item 2
Financial standby letters of credit and
foreign office guarantees.
Report the amount outstanding and unused as of the
report date of all ﬁnancial standby letters of credit (and
all legally binding commitments to issue ﬁnancial standby
letters of credit) issued by any office of the holding
company or its consolidated subsidiaries. A ﬁnancial
standby letter of credit irrevocably obligates the holding
company to pay a third-party beneﬁciary when a cus-
tomer (account party) fails to repay an outstanding loan
or debt instrument. (See the Glossary entry for ‘‘letter of
credit’’ for further information).
Exclude from ﬁnancial standby letters of credit the
following:
(1) Financial standby letters of credit where the beneﬁ-
ciary is a consolidated subsidiary of the holding
company.
(2) Financial standby letters of credit issued by another
depository institution (such as a correspondent bank),
a Federal Home Loan Bank, or any other entity on
behalf of the reporting holding company, which is the
account party on the letters of credit and therefore is
obligated to reimburse the issuing entity for all
payments made under the standby letters of credit
(report such standby letters of credit in Sched-
ule HC-L, item 9).
(3) Performance standby letters of credit.
(4) Signature or endorsement guarantees of the type
associated with the clearing of negotiable instru-
ments or securities in the normal course of business.

Amount of ﬁnancial standby letters
of credit conveyed to others.
Note: Item 2(a) is to be completed by holding companies

Report that portion of the consolidated holding com-
pany’s total contingent liability for ﬁnancial standby
letters of credit reported in item 2 that the holding
company has conveyed to others. Also, include that
portion of the reporting holding company’s ﬁnancial
standby letters of credit that are backed by other organi-
zations’ ﬁnancial standby letters of credit, as well as the
portion that participating holding companies have repar-
ticipated to others. Participations and backings may be
for any part or all of a given obligation.
Line Item 3
Performance standby letters of credit
and foreign office guarantees.
Report the amount outstanding and unused as of the
report date of all performance standby letters of credit
(and all legally binding commitments to issue perfor-
mance standby letters of credit) issued by any office of
the holding company or its consolidated subsidiaries. A
performance standby letter of credit irrevocably obligates
the holding company to pay a third-party beneﬁciary
when a customer (account party) fails to perform some
contractual non-ﬁnancial obligation. (See the Glossary
entry for ‘‘letter of credit’’ for further information).
Exclude from performance standby letters of credit the
following:
(1) Performance standby letters of credit where the bene-
ﬁciary is a consolidated subsidiary of the holding
company.
(2) Financial standby letters of credit.
(3) Signature or endorsement guarantees of the type
associated with the clearing of negotiable instru-
ments or securities in the normal course of business.
Line Item 3(a)
Amount of performance standby
letters of credit conveyed to others.
Note: Item 3(a) is to be completed by holding companies
with $5 billion or more in total assets.
Report that portion of the consolidated holding com-
pany’s total contingent liability for performance standby
letters of credit reported in item 3 that the holding
company has conveyed to others. Also, include that
portion of the reporting holding company’s performance
standby letters of credit that are backed by other organi-
zations’ ﬁnancial standby letters of credit, as well as the
portion that participating holding companies have repar-
ticipated to others. Participations and backings may be
for any part or all of a given obligation.

Securities lent. Report the appropriate amount of
all securities lent against collateral or on an uncollateral-
ized basis. Report the book value of holding company-
owned securities that have been lent. In addition, for
customers who have been indemniﬁed against any losses
by the reporting holding company or its consolidated
subsidiaries, report the market value as of the report date
of such customers’ securities, including customers’ secu-
rities held in the reporting holding company’s trust
department, that have been lent. If the reporting holding
company or its consolidated subsidiaries have indemni-
ﬁed their customers against any losses on their securities
that have been lent by the company or its subsidiaries, the
commitment to indemnify-either through a standby letter
of credit or other means-should not be reported in any
other item on Schedule HC-L.
6(b)
Securities borrowed. Report the appropriate
amount of all securities borrowed against collateral, or on
an uncollateralized basis. Report borrowed securities that
are fully collateralized by similar securities of equivalent
value at market value at the time they were borrowed. For
other borrowed securities report their market value as of
the report date.
Line Item 7
Credit derivatives.
Note: Items 7(a)(1) through 7(d)(2)(b) are to be reported
by holding companies with $5 billion or more in total
assets.
In general, credit derivatives are arrangements that allow
one party (the “protection purchaser” or “beneﬁciary”) to
transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” or “reference
entity” to another party (the “protection seller” or “guar-
antor”). Report the notional amounts of credit derivatives
by type of instrument in Schedule HC-L, items 7(a)(1)
through 7(a)(4). Report the gross positive and negative
fair values of all credit derivatives in Schedule HC-L,
items 7(b)(1) and 7(b)(2). For both the notional amounts
and gross fair values, report credit derivatives for which
the holding company is the protection seller in column A,
“Sold Protection,” and those on which the holding com-
pany is the protection purchaser in column B, “Purchased
Protection.” Report the notional amounts of credit deriva-
tives by regulatory capital treatment in Schedule HC-L,
items 7(c)(1)(a) through 7(c)(2)(c). Report the notional
amounts of credit derivatives by remaining maturity in
Schedule HC-L, items 7(d)(1)(a) through 7(d)(2)(b).
All notional amounts to be reported in items 7.a.(1)
through 7.a.(4), 7.c.(1)(a) through 7.c.(2)(c), and 7.d.(1)
(a) through 7.d.(2)(b) should be based on the notional
amount deﬁnition in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
Exclude notional amounts for credit derivatives that have
matured, but have associated unsettled receivables or
payables that are reported as assets or liabilities, respec-
tively, on the balance sheet as of the quarter-end report
date.
All credit derivative transactions within the consolidated
holding company should be reported on a net basis, i.e.,
intrabank transactions should not be reported in this item.
No other netting of contracts is permitted for purposes of
this item. Therefore, do not net the notional amounts or
fair values of: (1) credit derivatives with third parties on
which the reporting holding company is the protection
purchaser against credit derivatives with third parties on
which the reporting holding company is the protection
seller, or (2) contracts subject to bilateral netting agree-
ments. The notional amounts of credit derivatives should
not be included in Schedule HC-L, items 11 through 13,
and the fair values of credit derivatives should not be
included in Schedule HC-L, item 14.
Line Item 7(a)
Notional amounts.
Report in the appropriate subitem and column the
notional amount (stated in U.S. dollars) of all credit
derivatives. For tranched credit derivative transactions
that relate to an index, e.g., the Dow Jones CDX NA
index, report as the notional amount the dollar amount of
the tranche upon which the reporting holding company’s
credit derivative cash ﬂows are based.

Line Item 7(a)(1)
Credit default swaps.
Report in the appropriate column the notional amount of
all credit default swaps. A credit default swap is a
contract in which a protection seller or guarantor (risk
taker), for a fee, agrees to reimburse a protection pur-
chaser or beneﬁciary (risk hedger) for any losses that
occur due to a credit event on a particular entity, called
the ‘‘reference entity.’’ If there is no credit default event
(as deﬁned by the derivative contract), then the protec-
tion seller makes no payments to the protection purchaser
and receives only the contractually speciﬁed fee. Under
standard industry deﬁnitions, a credit event is normally
deﬁned to include bankruptcy, failure to pay, and restruc-
turing. Other potential credit events include obligation
acceleration,
obligation
default,
and
repudiation/
moratorium.
Line Item 7(a)(2)
Total return swaps.
Report in the appropriate column the notional amount of
all total return swaps. A total return swap transfers the
total economic performance of a reference asset, which
includes all associated cash ﬂows, as well as capital
appreciation or depreciation. The protection purchaser
(beneﬁciary) receives a ﬂoating rate of interest and any
depreciation on the reference asset from the protection
seller. The protection seller (guarantor) has the opposite
proﬁle. The protection seller receives cash ﬂows on the
reference asset, plus any appreciation, and it pays any
depreciation to the protection purchaser, plus a ﬂoating
interest rate. A total return swap may terminate upon a
default of the reference asset.
Line Item 7(a)(3)
Credit options.
Report in the appropriate column the notional amount of
all credit options. A credit option is a structure that
allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit
quality of the reference asset. For example, in a credit
spread option, the option writer (protection seller or
guarantor) assumes the obligation to purchase or sell the
reference asset at a speciﬁed ‘‘strike’’ spread level. The
option purchaser (protection purchaser or beneﬁciary)
buys the right to sell the reference asset to, or purchase it
from, the option writer at the strike spread level.
Line Item 7(a)(4)
Other credit derivatives.
Report in the appropriate column the notional amount of
all other credit derivatives. Other credit derivatives con-
sist of any credit derivatives not reportable as a credit
default swap, a total return swap, or a credit option.
Credit linked notes are cash securities and should not be
reported as other credit derivatives.
Line Item 7(b)
Gross fair values.
Report in the appropriate subitem and column the gross
fair values of all credit derivatives. As deﬁned in ASC
Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(formerly FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measure-
ments), fair value for an asset or liability is the price that
would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the
liability in an orderly transaction between market partici-
pants (not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) in the
asset’s or liability’s principal (or most advantageous)
market at the measurement date. For further information,
see the Glossary entry for ‘‘fair value.’’ For purposes of
this item, the reporting holding company should deter-
mine the fair value of its credit derivative contracts in the
same manner that it determines the fair value of these
contracts for other ﬁnancial reporting purposes.
Line Item 7(b)(1)
Gross positive fair value.
Report in the appropriate column the total fair value of
those credit derivatives reported in Schedule HC-L, items
7(a)(1) through 7(a)(4), above, with positive fair values.
Line Item 7(b)(2)
Gross negative fair value.
Report in the appropriate column the total fair value of
those credit derivatives reported in Schedule HC-L, items
7(a)(1) through 7(a)(4), above, with negative fair values.
Report the total fair value as an absolute value; do not
enclose the total fair value in parentheses or use a minus
(-) sign.
Line Item 7(c)
Notional amount of all credit
derivatives by regulatory capital treatment.
Report in the appropriate subitem the notional amount of
all credit derivative contracts according to the reporting
holding company’s treatment of the derivative for regu-
latory capital purposes. Because each subitem under item
7(c) is mutually exclusive, each credit derivative contract
should be reported in only one subitem.
Savings and loan holding companies that are not subject
to the revised regulatory capital rule should leave this
item blank.

Report the notional amount of credit derivative contracts
that are not covered positions under the Market Risk Rule
where the holding company is the protection purchaser
(beneﬁciary) and the protection is recognized as a guar-
antee for regulatory capital purposes. The credit deriva-
tive contracts to be reported in this item are limited to
those providing purchased protection where an under-
lying position (usually an asset of the holding company)
is being hedged by the protection and credit derivative
contract meets the criteria for recognition as a guarantee
under the Federal Reserve’s regulatory capital standards.
Line Item 7(c)(2)(c)
Purchased protection that is
not recognized as a guarantee for regulatory capital
purposes.
Report the notional amount of credit derivative contracts
that are not covered positions under the Market Risk Rule
where the holding company is the protection purchaser
(beneﬁciary) and the protection is not recognized as a
guarantee for regulatory capital purposes. The credit
derivative contracts to be reported in this item are limited
to those providing purchased protection where the protec-
tion is not being used to hedge an underlying position or
where the ‘‘hedging’’ credit derivative contract does not
meet the criteria for recognition as a guarantee under the
Federal Reserve’s regulatory capital standards. These
‘‘naked’’ purchased protection positions sometimes arise
when a holding company has sold the asset that was
being hedged by the credit derivative contract while
retaining the credit derivative contract.
Line Item 7(d)
Notional amounts by remaining

Report in the appropriate subitem and column the

Line Item 8
Spot foreign exchange contracts.
Report the gross amount (stated in U.S. dollars) of all
spot contracts committing the reporting holding company
to purchase foreign (non-U.S.) currencies and U.S. dollar
exchange that are outstanding as of the report date. All
transactions within the holding company should be
reported on a consolidated basis.
A spot contract is an agreement for the immediate
delivery, usually within two business days or less (depend-
ing on market convention), of a foreign currency at the
prevailing cash market rate. Contracts where market
convention is for delivery of a foreign currency in less
than two days, e.g., T+1 day (for example, Canadian
dollar-U.S. dollar contracts), should be reported as spot
contracts. Any contract exceeding the market convention
should be reported as a foreign exchange forward con-
tract in Schedule HC-L, item 11(b), column B. Spot
contracts are considered outstanding (i.e., open) until
they have been cancelled by acquisition or delivery of the
underlying currencies.
Only one side of a spot foreign exchange contract is to be
reported. In those transactions where foreign (non-U.S.)
currencies are bought or sold against U.S. dollars, report
only that side of the transaction that involves the foreign
(non-U.S.) currency. For example, if the reporting hold-
ing company enters into a spot contract which obligates

ule HC-L.
Report only the aggregate amount of those types of
‘‘other off-balance sheet items’’ that individually exceed
10 percent of the total equity capital reported in Schedule
HC, item 27(a). If the holding company has no types of
‘‘other off-balance sheet items’’ that individually exceed
10 percent of total equity capital, report a zero.
Disclose in items 9(a) through 9(f) each type of ‘‘other
off-balance sheet items’’ reportable in this item, and the
dollar amount of the off-balance sheet item, that individu-
ally exceeds 25 percent of the total equity capital reported
in Schedule HC, item 27(a). For each type of off-balance
sheet item that exceeds this disclosure threshold for
which a preprinted caption has not been provided,
describe the item with a clear but concise caption in
items 9(c) through 9(f). These descriptions should not
exceed 50 characters in length (including spacing between

(6) For holding companies with domestic offices only
and less than $100 billion in consolidated assets, the
gross amount (stated in U.S. dollars) of all spot
foreign exchange contracts committing the reporting
holding company to purchase foreign (non-U.S.)
currencies and U.S. dollar exchange that are outstand-
ing as of the report date. A spot contract is an
agreement for the immediate delivery, usually within
two business days or less (depending on market
convention), of a foreign currency at the prevailing
cash market rate. For information on the reporting of
spot foreign exchange contracts, refer to the instruc-
tions for Schedule HC-L, item 8, above.
Exclude the following from other off-balance-sheet items:
(1) All items that are required to be reported on the

Gross amounts (e.g., notional
amounts) of derivatives contracts.
Report in the appropriate column and subitem the gross
par value (stated in U.S. dollars) (e.g., futures, forwards,
and option contracts) or the notional amount (stated in
U.S. dollars) (e.g., forward rate agreements and swaps),
as appropriate, of all contracts that meet the deﬁnition of
a derivative and must be accounted for in accordance
with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly
FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended). Include
both freestanding derivative contracts and embedded
derivatives that must be accounted for separately from
their host contract under ASC Topic 815. Report each
contract according to its underlying risk exposure: inter-
est rate, foreign exchange, equity, and commodity and
other. Contracts with multiple risk characteristics should
be classiﬁed based upon the predominant risk character-
istics at the origination of the derivative. However,
exclude from Schedule HC-L, items 11 through 14, all
credit derivatives, which should be reported in Schedule
HC-L, item 7 above.
Also exclude notional amounts or par values for the
derivatives that have matured, but have associated
unsettled receivables or payables that are reported as
assets or liabilities respectively, on the balance sheet as of
the quarter as of the quarter-end report date. All notional
amounts or par values to be reported in Schedule HC-L,
items 12 through 15 should be based on the notional
amount deﬁnition in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
The notional amount or par value to be reported for a
derivative contract with a multiplier component is the
contract’s effective notional amount or par value. For
example, a swap contract with a stated notional amount
of $1,000,000 whose terms called for quarterly settle-
ment of the difference between 5% and LIBOR multi-
plied by 10 has an effective notional amount of
$10,000,000.
All transactions within the holding company should be
reported on a consolidated basis (i.e., intercompany
transactions should be eliminated). No other netting of

(2) written options against purchased options, or (3) con-
tracts subject to bilateral netting agreements.
For each column, the sum of Schedule HC-L, items 11(a)

Column Instructions
Column A
Interest Rate Contracts
Interest rate contracts are contracts related to an interest-
bearing ﬁnancial instrument or whose cash ﬂows are
determined by referencing interest rates or another inter-
est rate contract (e.g., an option on a futures contract to
purchase a Treasury bill). These contracts are generally
used to adjust the holding company’s interest rate expo-
sure or, if the holding company is an intermediary, the
interest rate exposure of others. Interest rate contracts
include single currency interest rate swaps, basis swaps,
forward rate agreements, and interest rate options, includ-
ing caps, ﬂoors, collars, and corridors.
Exclude contracts involving the exchange of one or more
foreign currencies (e.g., cross-currency swaps and cur-
rency options), which are to be reported in column B as
foreign exchange contracts. In addition, exclude other
contracts not involving the exchange of foreign currency
whose predominant risk characteristic is foreign exchange
risk, which are also to be reported in column B as foreign
exchange contracts.
Unsettled securities transactions that exceed regular way
settlement time limit that is customary in each relevant
market must be reported as forward contracts in Schedule
HC-L, item 11(b).
Column B
Foreign Exchange Contracts
Foreign exchange contracts are contracts to purchase
foreign (non-U.S.) currencies and U.S. dollar exchange in
the forward market, i.e., on an organized exchange or
in an over-the-counter market. A purchase of U.S. dollar
exchange is equivalent to a sale of foreign currency.
Foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency inter-
est rate swaps where there is an exchange of principal,
forward foreign exchange contracts (usually settling three
or more business days from trade date), and currency
futures and currency options. Exclude spot foreign
exchange contracts which are to be reported in Sched-
ule HC-L, item 8.
Only one side of a foreign currency transaction is to be
reported. In those transactions where foreign (non-U.S.)
currencies are bought or sold against U.S. dollars, report
only that side of the transaction that involves the foreign
(non-U.S.) currency. For example, if the reporting hold-
ing company enters into a futures contract which obli-
gates the holding company to purchase U.S. dollar
exchange against which it sells Japanese yen, then the
holding company would report (in U.S. dollar equivalent
values) the amount of Japanese yen sold in Schedule
HC-L,
item
11(a).
In
cross-currency
trans-
actions, which involve the purchase and sale of two
non-U.S. currencies, only the purchase side is to be
reported.
All amounts in column B are to be reported in U.S. dollar
equivalent values.
Column C
Equity Derivative Contracts
Equity derivative contracts are contracts that have a
return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a
particular equity or to an index of equity prices, such as
the Standard and Poor’s 500.
The contract amount to be reported for equity derivative
contracts is the quantity, e.g., number of units, of the
equity instrument or equity index contracted for purchase
or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit.
Column D
Commodity and Other Contracts
Commodity contracts are contracts that have a return, or
a portion of their return, linked to the price of or to an
index of precious metals, petroleum, lumber, agricultural
products, etc. Commodity and other contracts also include
any other contracts that are not reportable as interest rate,
foreign exchange, or equity derivative contracts.
The contract amount to be reported for commodity and
other contracts is the quantity, e.g., number of units, of
the commodity or product contracted for purchase or sale
multiplied by the contract price of a unit.
The notional amount to be reported for commodity
contracts with multiple exchanges of principal is the
contractual amount multiplied by the number of remain-
ing payments (i.e., exchanges of principal) in the con-
tract.

Line Item 11(a)
Futures contracts.
Futures contracts represent agreements for delayed deliv-
ery of ﬁnancial instruments or commodities in which the
buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver,
at a speciﬁed future date, a speciﬁed instrument at a
speciﬁed price or yield. Futures contracts are standard-
ized and are traded on organized exchanges that act as the
counterparty to each contract.
Report, in the appropriate column, the aggregate par
value of futures contracts that have been entered into by
the reporting holding company and are outstanding (i.e.,
open contracts) as of the report date. Do not report the par
value of ﬁnancial instruments intended to be delivered
under such contracts if this par value differs from the par
value of the contracts themselves.
Contracts are outstanding (i.e., open) until they have
been cancelled by acquisition or delivery of the under-
lying ﬁnancial instruments or by offset. Offset is the
liquidating of a purchase of futures through the sale of an
equal number of contracts of the same delivery month
on the same underlying instrument, or the covering of a
short sale of futures through the purchase of an equal
number of contracts of the same delivery month on the
same underlying instrument on the same exchange.
Column A, Interest Rate Futures.
Report futures
contracts committing the reporting holding company to
purchase or sell ﬁnancial instruments and whose pre-
dominant risk characteristic is interest rate risk. Some of
the more common interest rate futures include futures on
90-day U.S. Treasury bills; 12-year GNMA pass-through
securities; and 2-, 4-, 6-, and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes.
Column B, Foreign Exchange Futures.
Report the
gross amount (stated in U.S. dollars) of all futures
contracts committing the reporting holding company to
purchase foreign (non-U.S.) currencies and U.S. dollar
exchange and whose predominant risk characteristic is
foreign exchange risk.
A currency futures contract is a standardized agreement
for delayed delivery of a foreign (non-U.S.) currency or
U.S. dollar exchange in which the buyer agrees to
purchase and the seller agrees to deliver, at a speciﬁed
future date, a speciﬁed amount at a speciﬁed exchange
rate.
Column C, Equity Derivative Futures.
Report futures
contracts committing the reporting holding company to
purchase or sell equity securities or instruments based on
equity indexes such as the Standard and Poor’s 500, or
the Nikkei.
Column D, Commodity and Other Futures.
Report
the contract amount for all futures contracts committing
the reporting holding company to purchase or sell com-
modities such as agricultural products (e.g., wheat, cof-
fee), precious metals (e.g., gold, platinum), and nonfer-
rous metals (e.g., copper, zinc). Include any other futures
contract that is not reportable as an interest rate, foreign
exchange, or equity derivative contract in column A, B,
or C.
Line Item 11(b)
Forward contracts.
Forward contracts represent agreements for delayed
delivery of ﬁnancial instruments or commodities in which
the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to
deliver, at a speciﬁed future date, a speciﬁed instrument
or commodity at a speciﬁed price or yield. Forward
contracts are not traded on organized exchanges and their
contractual terms are not standardized.
Report the notional value of forward contracts that
have been entered into by the reporting holding company
and are outstanding (i.e., open contracts) as of the report
date. Do not report ﬁnancial instruments intended to be
delivered under such contracts if this notional value
differs from the notional value of the contracts themselves.
Contracts are outstanding (i.e., open) until they have
been cancelled by acquisition or delivery of the under-
lying ﬁnancial instruments or settled in cash. Such con-
tracts can only be terminated, other than by receipt of the
underlying asset, by agreement of both buyer and seller.
Include as forward contracts in this item contracts for the
purchase and sale of when-issued securities that are not
excluded from the requirements of ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging (formerly FASB Statement
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, as amended). Report contracts for the

Line Item 11(c)
Exchange-traded option contracts.
Option contracts convey either the right or the obligation,
depending upon whether the reporting holding company
is the purchaser or the writer, respectively, to buy or sell a
ﬁnancial instrument or commodity at a speciﬁed price by
a speciﬁed future date. Some options are traded on
organized exchanges.
The buyer of an option contract has, for compensation
(such as a fee or premium), acquired the right (or option)
to sell to, or purchase from, another party some ﬁnancial
instrument or commodity at a stated price on a speciﬁed
future date. The seller of the contract has, for such
compensation, become obligated to purchase or sell the
ﬁnancial instrument or commodity at the option of the
buyer of the contract. A put option contract obligates
the seller of the contract to purchase some ﬁnancial
instrument or commodity at the option of the buyer of the
contract. A call option contract obligates the seller of the
contract to sell some ﬁnancial instrument or commodity
at the option of the buyer of the contract.

Over-the-counter option contracts.
Option contracts convey either the right or the obligation,
depending upon whether the reporting holding company
is the purchaser or the writer, respectively, to buy or sell a
ﬁnancial instrument or commodity at a speciﬁed price by
a speciﬁed future date. Options can be written to meet the
specialized needs of the counterparties to the transaction.
These customized option contracts are known as over-
the-counter (OTC) options. Thus, over-the-counter option
contracts include all option contracts not traded on an
organized exchange.
The buyer of an option contract has, for compensation
(such as a fee or premium), acquired the right (or option)
to sell to, or purchase from, another party some ﬁnancial
instrument or commodity at a stated price on a speciﬁed
future date. The seller of the contract has, for such
compensation, become obligated to purchase or sell the
ﬁnancial instrument or commodity at the option of the
buyer of the contract. A put option contract obligates the
seller of the contract to purchase some ﬁnancial instru-
ment or commodity at the option of the buyer of the
contract. A call option contract obligates the seller of the
contract to sell some ﬁnancial instrument or commodity
at the option of the buyer of the contract.
In addition, swaptions, i.e., options to enter into a swap-
contract, and contracts known as caps, ﬂoors, collars, and
corridors3 should be reported as options.
Commitments to lend that meet the deﬁnition of a
derivative and must be accounted for in accordance with
ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly
3. A cap is a contract under which the purchaser has, for compensation
(such as a fee or premium), acquired the right to receive a payment from
the seller if a speciﬁed index rate, e.g., LIBOR, rises above a designated
strike rate. Payments are based on the principal amount or notional amount
of the cap, although no exchange of principal takes place. A ﬂoor is similar
to a cap except that the purchaser has, for compensation (such as a fee or
premium), acquired the right to receive a payment from the seller if the
speciﬁed index rate falls below the strike rate. A collar is the simultaneous
purchase of a cap (with a strike rate at one index rate) and sale of a ﬂoor
(with a strike rate at a lower index rate), designed to maintain interest rates.

Line Item 11(e)
Swaps.
Swaps are contracts in which two parties agree to
exchange payment streams based on a speciﬁed notional
amount for a speciﬁed period. Forward starting swap
contracts should be reported as swaps. The notional
amount of a swap is the underlying principal amount
upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or
other income or expense is based. The notional amount
reported for a swap contract with a multiplier component
is the contract’s effective notional amount. In those cases
where the reporting holding company is acting as an
intermediary, both sides of the transaction are to be
reported.
Column A, Interest Rate Swaps.
Report the notional
amount of all outstanding interest rate and basis swaps
whose predominant risk characteristic is interest rate risk.
Column B, Foreign Exchange Swaps.
Report the
notional principal amount (stated in U.S. dollars) of all
outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps.
A cross-currency interest rate swap is a contract in which
two parties agree to exchange principal amounts of
different currencies, usually at the prevailing spot rate, at
the inception of an agreement which lasts for a certain
number of years. At deﬁned intervals over the life of the
swap, the counterparties exchange payments in the differ-
ent currencies based on speciﬁed rates of interest. When
the agreement matures, the principal amounts will be
re-exchanged at the same spot rate. The notional amount
of a cross-currency interest rate swap is generally the
underlying principal amount upon which the exchange is
based.
Column C, Equity Swaps.
Report the notional amount
of all outstanding equity or equity index swaps.
Column D, Commodity and Other Swaps.
Report the
notional principal amount of all other swap contracts that
are not reportable as either interest rate, foreign exchange,
or equity derivative contracts in column A, B, or C. The
notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts
with multiple exchanges of principal is the contractual
amount multiplied by the number of remaining payments
(or exchanges of principal) in the contract.
Line Item 12
Total gross notional amount of
derivative contracts held for trading.
Report in the appropriate column, the total notional
amount or par value of those off-balance- sheet derivative
contracts in Schedule HC-L, item 11 above that are held
for trading purposes. Contracts held for trading purposes
include those used in dealing and other trading activities
accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recog-
nized in earnings. Derivative instruments used to hedge
trading activities should also be reported in this item.
Derivative trading activities include (a) regularly dealing
in interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts,
equity derivative contracts, and other contracts meeting
the deﬁnition of a “derivative instrument” in, and
accounted for in accordance with, ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging, (b) acquiring or taking posi-
tions in such items principally for the purpose of selling
in the near term or otherwise with the intent to resell (or
repurchase) in order to proﬁt from short-term price
movements, or (c) acquiring or taking positions in such
items as an accommodation to customers, provided that
acquiring or taking such positions meets the deﬁnitions
of “trading” and “trading purposes” in ASC Topic 815.
The notional amount of those derivative positions acquired
or taken as accommodations to customers not meeting
the deﬁnitions of “trading” and “trading purposes” in
ASC Topic 815 should be reported in Schedule HC-L,
item 13, “Total gross notional amount of derivative
contracts held for purposes other than trading.″
The trading department of a holding company or its
subsidiaries may have entered into a derivative contract
with another department or business unit within the
consolidated holding company (and which has been
reported on a consolidated basis in accordance with the
instructions to Schedule HC-L, item 11 above). If the
trading department has also entered into a matching
contract with a counterparty outside the consolidated
holding company, the contract with the outside counter-
party should be designated as held for trading or as held
for purposes other than trading consistent with the con-
tract’s designation for other ﬁnancial reporting purposes.

Gross fair values of derivative
contracts.
Report in the appropriate column and subitem below the
fair (or market) value of all derivative contracts reported
in Schedule HC-L, items 12 and 13 above. For each of
the four types of underlying risk exposure in columns A
through D, the gross positive and gross negative fair
values will be reported separately below for contracts
held for trading (item 14(a)), and contracts held for
purposes other than trading (item 14(b)). Guidance for
reporting by type of underlying risk exposure is provided
in Schedule HC-L, item 11 above. Guidance for reporting
by purpose and accounting methodology is provided
in the instructions for Schedule HC-L, items 12 and 13
above.
All transactions within the holding company should be
reported on a consolidated basis. For purposes of this
item, do not net (1) obligations of the reporting holding
company to buy against the holding company’s obliga-
tions to sell, (2) written options against purchased
options, (3) positive fair values against negative fair
values, or (4) contracts subject to bilateral netting agree-
ments.
According to ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures fair value is deﬁned as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market partici-
pants in the asset’s or liability’s principal (or most
advantageous) market at the measurement date. For
purposes of item 14, the reporting holding company
should determine the fair value of its derivative contracts
in the same manner that it determines the fair value of
these contracts for other ﬁnancial reporting purposes,
consistent with the guidance in ASC Topic 820.

liquidity of investments in the fund.
Column D, Sovereign Governments: Sovereign govern-
ments are the central governments of foreign countries.
Column E, Corporations and All Other Counterparties:
Corporations and all other counterparties include all
counterparties other than those included in columns A, C
and D above.
Line Item 15(a)
Net current credit exposure.
Report in the appropriate column the sum of the net
current credit exposures on OTC derivative contracts by
type of counterparty. The sum of the net current credit
exposures reported in columns A through E for this item
may not equal the amount reported in Schedule HC-R,
Part II Memorandum item 1, ‘‘Current credit exposure
across all derivative contracts covered by the risk-based
capital standards,’’ because the amount reported in
Schedule HC-R, Memorandum item 1, excludes, for
example, OTC derivatives not covered by the risk-based
capital standards. All transactions within the consoli-
dated holding company should be reported on a net basis.
The current credit exposure (sometimes referred to as the
replacement cost) is the fair value of a derivative contract
when that fair value is positive. The current credit
exposure is zero when the fair value is negative or zero.
For purposes of this item, the net current credit exposure
to an individual counterparty should be derived as fol-
lows: Determine whether a legally enforceable bilateral
netting agreement is in place between the reporting
holding company and the counterparty. If such an agree-
ment is in place, the fair values of all applicable deriva-
tive contracts with that counterparty that are included in
the scope of the netting agreement are netted to a single
amount, which may be positive, negative, or zero.
Line Item 15(b)
Fair value of collateral.
Report in the appropriate subitem and column the total
fair value of the collateral pledged by counterparties to
secure OTC derivative transactions by type of counter-
party, even if the fair value of the collateral as of the
report date exceeds the net current credit exposure to a
counterparty or the current credit exposure to a counter-
party is zero. Include the fair value of collateral in the
reporting holding company’s possession and collateral
held on the holding company’s behalf by third party
custodians.

Schedule HC-M

been reﬂected in the measurement of the reporting hold-
ing company’s indemniﬁcation asset, which represents
the right to receive payments from the FDIC under the
loss-sharing agreement.
Under a loss-sharing agreement, the FDIC agrees to
absorb a portion of the losses on a speciﬁed pool of a
failed insured depository institution’s assets in order to
maximize asset recoveries and minimize the FDIC’s
losses. In general, the maximum amount recoverable
from the FDIC on covered other real estate owned is the
carrying amount of the other real estate, as reported in
Schedule HC, item 7, “Other real estate owned,” multi-
plied by the currently applicable loss coverage rate (e.g.,
80 percent or 95 percent). This product will normally be
the maximum amount recoverable because reimburse-
ments from the FDIC for covered losses related to the
amount by which the ‘‘book value’’ of a covered asset on
the failed institution’s books (which is the amount upon
which payments under an FDIC loss-sharing agreement
are based) exceeds the amount at which the reporting
bank reports the covered asset on Schedule HC, Balance
Sheet, should already have been taken into account in
measuring the carrying amount of the reporting bank’s
loss-sharing indemniﬁcation asset, which is reported in
Schedule HC-F, item 6, “Other” assets.
Note: Schedule HC-M 7(a) and 7(b) are to be completed

life, accident, and health insurance; disability insurance;
and employee beneﬁts coverage. Report total assets
before eliminating intercompany transactions between
the consolidated insurance subsidiary and other offices or
subsidiaries of the consolidated bank company.
Line Item 7(b)
Total assets of captive reinsurance
subsidiaries.
Report the carrying amount of all assets held by consoli-
dated captive reinsurance subsidiaries of the reporting
holding company. Reinsurance is the transfer, with
indemniﬁcation, of all or part of the underwriting risk
from one insurer to another for a portion of the premium
or other consideration. For further information, see the
Glossary entry for “Reinsurance.”
Some common lines of business include credit life,
accident, and health reinsurance; disability reinsurance;
reinsurance of employee beneﬁts coverage; private mort-
gage guaranty reinsurance; and terrorism risk reinsur-
ance. Report total assets before eliminating intercompany
transactions between the consolidated reinsurance subsid-
iary and other offices or subsidiaries of the consolidated

of the official responsible for verifying the FR Y-10.
Line Item 12
Intangible assets.
Report in the appropriate subitem the carrying amount of
intangible assets. Intangible assets primarily result from
business combinations accounted for under the acquisi-
tion method in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Busi-
ness Combinations, from acquisitions of portions or
segments of another institution’s business such as mort-
gage servicing portfolios, and credit card portfolios, and
from the sale or securitization of ﬁnancial assets with
servicing retained.
An identiﬁable intangible asset with a ﬁnite life (other
than a servicing asset) should be amortized over its
estimated useful life and should be reviewed at least
quarterly to determine whether events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not
be recoverable. If this review indicates that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable, the identiﬁable intan-
gible asset should be tested for recoverability (impair-
ment) in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property,
Plant, and Equipment. An impairment loss shall be
recognized if the carrying amount of the identiﬁable
intangible asset is not recoverable and this amount
exceeds the asset’s fair value. The carrying amount is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted
expected future cash ﬂows from the identiﬁable intan-
gible asset. An impairment loss is recognized by writing
the identiﬁable intangible asset down to its fair value
(which becomes the new accounting basis of the intan-
gible asset), with a corresponding charge to expense
(which should be reported in Schedule HI, item 7(c)(2)).
Subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impair-
ment loss is prohibited.
An identiﬁable intangible asset with an indeﬁnite useful
life should not be amortized, but should be tested for
impairment at least annually in accordance with ASC
Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.
Line Item 12(a)
Mortgage servicing assets.
Report the carrying amount of mortgage servicing assets,
i.e., the cost of acquiring contracts to service loans
secured by real estate (as deﬁned for Schedule HC-C,
item 1, and in the Glossary entry for “Loans Secured by
Real Estate”) that have been securitized or are owned by
another party, net of any related valuation allowances.
Servicing assets resulting from contracts to service ﬁnan-
cial assets other than loans secured by real estate should
be reported in line item 12(b). For further information,
see the Glossary entry for “Servicing Assets and
Liabilities.”
Line Item 12(a)(1)
Estimated fair value of
mortgage servicing assets.
Report the estimated fair value of the capitalized mort-
gage servicing assets reported in Schedule HC-M,
item 12(a) above.
According to ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures (formerly FASB Statement No. 157,
Fair Value Measurements), fair value is deﬁned as the
price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly
transaction between market participants in the asset’s
principal (or most advantageous) market at the measure-
ment date. For purposes of this item, the reporting
holding company should determine the fair value of
mortgage servicing assets in the same manner that deter-
mines the fair value of these assets for other ﬁnancial
reporting purposes, consistent with the guidance in ASC
Topic 820.
Line Item 12(b)
Goodwill.
Report the carrying amount of goodwill as adjusted for
any impairment losses and, if the private company good-
will accounting alternative has been elected, the amorti-
zation of goodwill. Except when this accounting alterna-
tive has been elected, goodwill should not be amortized.
However, regardless of whether goodwill is amortized, it
must be tested for impairment as described in the Glos-
sary entry for “Goodwill.” See “Acquisition Method” in
the Glossary entry for “Business Combinations” for
guidance on the recognition and initial measurement of
goodwill acquired in a business combination.

Line Item 12(c)
All identiﬁable intangible assets.
Report the carrying amount of all other speciﬁcally
identiﬁable intangible assets such as core deposit intan-
gibles, favorable leashold rights, purchased credit card
relationships, and nonmortgage servicing assets.
Purchased credit card relationships represent the right to
conduct ongoing credit card business dealings with the
cardholders. In general, purchased credit card relation-
ships are an amount paid in excess of the value of the
purchased credit card receivables. Such relationships
arise when the reporting bank purchases existing credit
card receivables and also has the right to provide credit
card services to those customers. Purchased credit card
relationships may also be acquired when the reporting
bank purchases an entire depository institution.
Purchased credit card relationships shall be carried at
amortized cost. Management of the institution shall
review the carrying amount at least quarterly, adequately
document this review, and adjust the carrying amount as
necessary. This review should determine whether unan-
ticipated acceleration or deceleration of cardholder pay-
ments, account attrition, changes in fees or ﬁnance
charges, or other events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the purchased credit
card relationships may not be recoverable. If this review
indicates that the carrying amount may not be recover-
able, the intangible asset should be tested for recoverabil-
ity, and any impairment loss should be recognized, as
described in the instruction for Schedule HC-M, item 2.
Nonmortgage servicing assets are contracts to service
ﬁnancial assets, other than loans secured by real estate (as
deﬁned for Schedule HC-C, item 1) under which the
estimated future revenues from contractually speciﬁed
servicing fees, late charges, and other ancillary revenues
are expected to more than adequately compensate the
servicer for performing the servicing. A nonmortgage
servicing contract is either (a) undertaken in conjunction
with selling or securitizing the nonmortgage ﬁnancial
assets being serviced or (b) purchased or assumed sepa-
rately. For nonmortgage servicing assets accounted for
under the amortization method, the carrying amount is
the unamortized cost of acquiring the nonmortgage ser-
vicing contracts, net of any related valuation allowances.
For nonmortgage servicing assets accounted for under
the fair value method, the carrying amount is the fair
value of the nonmortgage servicing contracts. For further
information, see the Glossary entry for “Servicing Assets
and Liabilities.”
Line Item 12(d)
Total.
Report the sum of items 12(a), 12(b) and 12(c). This
amount must equal Schedule HC, item 10, “Intangible

Line Item 13
Other real estate owned.
Report the net book value of all real estate other than
(1) holding company premises owned or controlled by
the holding company and its consolidated subsidiaries
(which should be reported in Schedule HC, item 6) and
(2) direct and indirect investments in real estate ventures
(which should be reported in Schedule HC, item 9). Also
exclude real estate property collateralizing a fully or
partially government-guaranteed mortgage loan for which
the holding company has received physical possession
and the conditions speciﬁed in ASC Subtopic 310-20,
“Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs’’,
were met upon foreclosure. In such a situation, rather
than recognizing other real estate owned upon foreclo-
sure, the holding company must recognize a separate
“other receivable,” which should be measured based on
the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest)
expected to be recovered from the guarantor. Report such
a receivable in Schedule HC-F, item 6, “All other assets.”
For further information, see the Glossary entry for “Fore-
closed Assets.” Do not deduct mortgages or other liens
on such property (report mortgages or other liens in
Schedule HC, item 16, ‘‘Other borrowed money’’).
Amounts should be reported net of any applicable valua-
tion allowances.
Include as all other real estate owned:
(1) Foreclosed real estate, i.e.,
(a) Real estate acquired in any manner for debts previ-
ously contracted (including, but not limited to, real estate
acquired through foreclosure and real estate acquired by
deed in lieu of foreclosure), even if the holding company
has not yet received title to the property.
(b) Real estate collateral underlying a loan when the
holding company has obtained physical possession of
the collateral. (For further information see Glossary
entries for “Foreclosed Assets” and “Troubled Debt-
Restructurings.”)
Schedule HC-M
HC-M-4
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-M
December 2024

Foreclosed real estate received in full or partial satisfac-
tion of a loan should be recorded at the fair value less
cost to sell of the property at the time of foreclosure. This
amount becomes the ‘‘cost’’ of the foreclosed real estate.
When foreclosed real estate is received in full satisfaction
of a loan, the amount, if any, by which the recorded
amount of the loan exceeds the fair value less cost to sell
of the property is a loss which must be charged to the
allowance for credit losses on loans and leases at the time
of foreclosure. The amount of any senior debt (principal
and accrued interest) to which foreclosed real estate is
subject at the time of foreclosure must be reported as a
liability in Schedule HC, item 16, “Other borrowed
money.”
After foreclosure, each foreclosed real estate asset must
be carried at the lower of (1) the fair value of the asset
minus the estimated costs to sell the asset or (2) the cost
of the asset (as deﬁned in the preceding paragraph). This
determination must be made on an asset-by-asset basis. If
the fair value of a foreclosed real estate asset minus the
estimated costs to sell the asset is less than the asset’s
cost, the deﬁciency must be recognized as a valuation
allowance against the asset which is created through a
charge to expense. The valuation allowance should there-
after be increased or decreased (but not below zero)
through charges or credits to expense for changes in the
asset’s fair value or estimated selling costs. (For further
information, see the Glossary entries for “Foreclosed
Assets.”
(2) Foreclosed real estate collateralizing mortgage loans
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Admin-
istration (FHA), the Department of Agriculture under
the Rural Development (RD) program (formerly the
Farmers Home Administration (FmHA)), or the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or guaranteed
by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
and administered by the Office of Public and Indian
Housing (PIH) that back Government National Mort-
gage Association (GNMA) securities, i.e., ″GNMA
loans,″ if the mortgage loans did not meet the
conditions speciﬁed in ASC Subtopic 310-40 requir-

Does the holding company sell
private label or third party mutual funds and
annuities?
Indicate whether the reporting holding company cur-
rently sells private label or third party mutual funds and
annuities.
Place “1” for yes if the holding company, a holding
company subsidiary or other affiliate, or an unaffiliated
entity sells private label or third party mutual funds and
annuities:
(1) on premises of the holding company;
(2) from which the holding company receives income at
the time of the sale or over the duration of the
account (e.g., annual fees, Rule 12b-1 fees or ‘‘trailer
fees,’’ and redemption fees); or
(3) through the reporting holding company’s trust depart-
ment in transactions that are not executed in a
ﬁduciary capacity (e.g., trustee, executor, administra-
tor, conservator).
Otherwise, enter “0” for no.
Mutual fund is the common name for an open-end
investment company whose shares are sold to the invest-
ing public. An annuity is an investment product, typically
underwritten by an insurance company, that pays either a
ﬁxed or variable payment stream over a speciﬁed period
of time. Both proprietary and private label mutual funds
and annuities are established in order to be marketed
primarily to a banking organization’s customers. A pro-
prietary product is a product for which the reporting
holding company or a subsidiary or other affiliate of the
reporting holding company acts as investment adviser
and may perform additional support services. In a private
label product, an unaffiliated entity acts as the investment
adviser. The identity of the investment adviser is nor-
mally disclosed in the prospectus for a mutual fund or
annuity. Mutual funds and annuities that are not propri-
etary or private label products are considered third party
products. For example, third party mutual funds and
annuities include products that are widely marketed by
numerous parties to the investing public and have invest-
ment advisers that are not affiliated with the reporting
holding company.
Line Item 16
Assets under management in
proprietary mutual funds and annuities.
Report the amount of assets (stated in U.S. dollars) held
by mutual funds and annuities as of the report date for
which the reporting holding company or a subsidiary of
the holding company acts as investment adviser.
A general description of a proprietary product is included
in the instruction to Schedule HC-M, item 15, above.
Proprietary mutual funds and annuities are typically
created by large banking organizations and offered to
customers of the banking organization’s subsidiary banks.
Therefore, small, independent banks do not normally act
as investment advisers for mutual funds and annuities.
If neither the holding company nor any subsidiary of the
holding company acts as investment adviser for a mutual
fund or annuity, the holding company should report a
zero in this item.
Information related to the ﬁling of the
FR Y-12 report (Line Items 17, 18, 19(a),
19(b))
Line items 17 and 18 will be used to determine if the
reporting holding company must complete the Consoli-
dated Holding Company Report of Equity Investments in
Nonﬁnancial Companies (FR Y-12). In a multi-tiered
organization with one or more holding companies, only
the top-tier holding company should complete items 17
and 18 on a consolidated basis. However, if a lower-tier
holding company is functioning as the consolidated
top-tier reporter for other ﬁnancial reports (for example,
when the top-tier is a non-U.S. holding company, ESOP,
or limited partnership), this lower-tier holding company
should complete items 17 and 18 on a consolidated basis.

Line Item 17
Does the holding company hold,
either directly or indirectly through a subsidiary or
affiliate, any nonﬁnancial equity investments within
a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)
structure, or under section 4(c)(6) or 4(c)(7) of the
Bank Holding Company Act, or pursuant to the
merchant banking authority of section 4(k)4(H) of
the Bank Holding Company Act, or pursuant to the
investment authority granted by Regulation K?
Enter a “1” if the answer to this question is yes. Enter a
“0” if the response to this question is no. If the answer to
this question is no, your organization does not need to
complete the FR Y-12. Skip items 18 and proceed to items
19(a) and 19(b). If the answer to this question is yes,
proceed to item 18 below.
For purposes of this question, an equity investment refers
to common stock, partnership interests, convertible pre-
ferred stock, convertible debt, and warrants, options, and
other rights that give the holder the right to acquire
common stock or instruments convertible into common
stock. An equity investment does not include any posi-
tion or security held in a trading account in accordance
with applicable accounting principles and as part of an
underwriting, market making or dealing activity.
A nonﬁnancial equity investment means an equity invest-
ment made by the holding company or any of its subsid-
iaries (including all U.S. offices, International Banking
Facilities, foreign branches, branches in Puerto Rico and
U.S. territories and possessions, and majority-owned
bank and nonbank domestic and foreign subsidiaries,
including Edge and agreement subsidiaries, domestic
nonbanking subsidiaries, and small business investment
companies (SBICs)):
• pursuant to the merchant banking authority of section
4(k)(4)(H) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(k)(4)(H))
and subpart J of the Board’s Regulation Y,
• under section 4(c)(6) or 4(c)(7) of the BHC Act
(12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(6) and (c)(7)) in a nonﬁnancial
company (as deﬁned below) or in a company that
makes investments in nonﬁnancial companies,
• investments made through a SBIC that is consolidated
with the holding company or subsidiary, or in an SBIC
that is not consolidated, under section 302(b) of the
Small Business Investment Act of 1958,
• in a nonﬁnancial company under the portfolio invest-
ment provisions of the Board’s Regulation K (12 CFR
211.8(c)(3), or
• in a nonﬁnancial company under section 24 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831a).
This question does not apply to equity investments that a
holding company or any of its subsidiaries may make
under other legal authorities. For example, this question
does not apply to nonﬁnancial investments made by an
insurance company subsidiary of a ﬁnancial holding
company under section 4(k)(4)(I) of the BHC Act
(12 U.S.C. 1843(k)(4)(I)). Also, this question does not
apply to DPC investments.
A nonﬁnancial company is a company that is engaged in
any activity that has not been determined to be ﬁnancial
in nature or incidental to a ﬁnancial activity under
section 4(k) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(k)).
Line Item 18
Do your aggregate nonﬁnancial
equity investments equal or exceed the lesser of
$100 million (on an acquisition cost basis) or
10 percent of the holding company’s consolidated
Tier 1 capital as of the report date?
Enter a ‘‘1’’ if the answer to this question is yes. Enter a
‘‘0’’ if the response to this question is no. If the answer to
both item 17 and item 18 is yes, your organization must
complete the FR Y-12. Skip items 19.a and 19.b, and
proceed to item 20 below. If the answer to either item 17
or item 18 is no, your organization does not need to
complete the FR Y-12. Proceed to items 19(a) and 19(b)
below.
See the instructions for item 17 above for the deﬁnition
of nonﬁnancial equity investment.
Acquisition cost is the amount paid by the holding
company for the nonﬁnancial equity investment when it

investments for others by serving as a general partner in a
limited partnership or performing a similar function in a
private equity fund. These investments are not owned by
the holding company and are not consolidated in the

Issuances associated with the U.S.
Department of Treasury Capital Purchase Program.
Under the U.S. Department of Treasury Capital Purchase
Program (CPP), the Treasury provides capital to partici-
pating holding companies by purchasing newly issued
senior perpetual preferred stock and warrants to purchase
common stock, depending on whether the holding com-
pany’s common stock is ‘‘publicly traded.’’ For such
holding companies that are not publicly traded, the
Treasury Department immediately exercises the warrants
for senior perpetual preferred stock (‘‘warrant preferred
stock’’). This perpetual preferred stock and warrant pre-
ferred stock is senior to the holding company’s common
stock and on par with the issuer’s existing preferred
shares. All senior perpetual preferred stock issued pro-
vides for cumulative dividends, but for regulatory capital
purposes is treated the same as noncumulative perpetual
preferred stock as an unrestricted core capital element
included in Tier 1 capital.

Warrants issued by a publicly traded holding company
should be included in equity capital on the balance sheet
provided the holding company has sufficient authorized
but unissued shares of the common stock to allow
exercise of the warrants and any other necessary share-
holder approvals have been obtained. If the holding
company does not have required shareholder approval,

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans, Leases,
and Other Assets
Schedule HC-N
General Instructions
Report on a fully consolidated basis all loans, leases, debt
securities, and other assets that are past due or are in
nonaccrual status, regardless of whether such credits are
secured or unsecured and regardless of whether such
credits are guaranteed or insured by the U.S. Government
or by others.
For assets that are past due or in nonaccrual status,
holding companies should report the balance sheet
amount of the asset in Schedule HC-N without deducting
any applicable allowance for credit losses, not simply the
asset’s delinquent payments. For example, the amount to
be reported in Schedule HC-N for a past due or nonac-
crual loan held for investment should equal the amount at
which the loan is reported in Schedule HC, Balance
Sheet, item 4.b, “Loans and leases held for investment.”
The amount to be reported in Schedule HC-N, item 10,
for a past due or nonaccrual held-to-maturity debt secu-
rity should equal the amortized cost at which the debt
security is reported in Schedule HC-B, Securities, col-
umn A.
Loan amounts should be reported net of unearned income
to the extent that they are reported net of unearned
income in Schedule HC-C. All lease, debt security, and
other asset amounts must be reported net of unearned
income.
For purposes of these reports, “GNMA loans” are resi-
dential mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by the
Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department
of Agriculture Rural Development (RD) program (for-
merly the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA)), or
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or guaranteed
by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and
administered by the Office of Public and Indian Housing
(PIH) that back Government National Mortgage Associa-
tion (GNMA) securities. When a holding company ser-
vices GNMA loans after it has securitized the loans in a
transfer accounted for as a sale, ASC Topic 860, Trans-
fers and Servicing (formerly FASB Statement No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” as amended)
requires the holding company to bring individual delin-
quent GNMA loans that it previously accounted for as
sold back onto its books as loan assets when, under the
GNMA Mortgage-Backed Securities Guide, the loan
meets GNMA’s speciﬁed delinquency criteria and is
eligible for repurchase. This rebooking of GNMA loans
is required regardless of whether the holding company, as
seller-servicer, intends to exercise the repurchase (buy-
back) option. A seller-servicer must report all delinquent
rebooked GNMA loans that have been repurchased or are
eligible for repurchase as past due in Schedule HC-N in
accordance with their contractual repayment terms. In
addition, if a holding company services GNMA loans,
but was not the transferor of the loans that were securi-
tized, and purchases individual delinquent loans out of
the GNMA securitization, the holding company must
report the purchased loans as past due in Schedule HC-N
in accordance with their contractual repayment terms
even though the holding company was not required to
record the delinquent GNMA loans as assets prior to
purchasing the loans. Such delinquent GNMA loans
should be reported in items 1(c), 11, and 11(b) of
Schedule HC-N.
Deﬁnitions
Past Due—The past due status of a loan or other asset
should be determined in accordance with its contractual
repayment terms. For purposes of this schedule, grace
periods allowed by the holding company after a loan or
other asset technically has become past due but before
the imposition of late charges are not to be taken into
account in determining past due status. Furthermore,
loans, leases, debt securities, and other assets are to be
FR Y-9C
HC-N-1
Schedule HC-N
March 2024

reported as past due when either interest or principal is
unpaid in the following circumstances:
(1) Closed-end installment loans, amortizing loans
secured by real estate, and any other loans and lease
ﬁnancing receivables with payments scheduled
monthly are to be reported as past due when the
borrower is in arrears two or more monthly pay-
ments. (At a holding company’s option, loans and
leases with payments scheduled monthly may be
reported as past due when one scheduled payment is
due and unpaid for 30 days or more.) Other multipay-
ment obligations with payments scheduled other than
monthly are to be reported as past due when one
scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or
more.
(2) Open-end credit such as charge-card plans, check
credit, and other revolving credit plans are to be
reported as past due when the customer has not made
the minimum payment for two or more billing cycles.
(3) Single payment and demand notes, debt securities,
and other assets providing for the payment of interest
at stated intervals are to be reported as past due after
one interest payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or
more.
(4) Single payment notes, debt securities, and other
assets providing for the payment of interest at matu-
rity are to be reported as past due after maturity if
interest or principal remains unpaid for 30 days or
more.
(5) Unplanned overdrafts are to be reported as past due if
the account remains continuously overdrawn for
30 days or more.
For purposes of this schedule, a full payment in comput-
ing past due status for consumer installment loans (both
closed-end and open-end) is deﬁned to include a partial
payment equivalent to 90 percent or more of the contrac-
tual payment.
Purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans and debt securities
held as of the adoption date of ASC Topic 326, Financial
Instruments-Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326) should pro-
spectively be accounted for as a purchased credit-
deteriorated (PCD) ﬁnancial assets. As of the adoption
date of the standard, the remaining noncredit discount or
premium on a PCD asset, after the adjustment for the
allowance for credit losses, should be accreted to interest
income at the new effective interest rate, if the asset is not
required to be placed on nonaccrual. For a PCD loan,
debt security, or other ﬁnancial asset within the scope of
ASC Topic 326 that is not reported in nonaccrual status,
the delinquency status of the PCD asset should be
determined in accordance with its contractual repayment
terms for purposes of reporting the amortized cost basis
of the asset (fair value for a PCD available-for-sale debt
security) as past due in Schedule HC-N, column A or B,
as appropriate. If the PCD asset that is not reported in
nonaccrual status consists of a pool of loans that was
previously PCI, but is being maintained as a unit of
account after the adoption of ASC Topic 326, delin-
quency status should be determined individually for each
loan in the pool in accordance with the individual loan’s
contractual repayment terms. For further information, see
the Glossary entry for “Purchased Credit-Deteriorated
Assets.”
NOTE:
The time period used for reporting past due
status as indicated above may not in all instances con-
form to those utilized by federal bank regulators in bank
examinations.
Nonaccrual—For purposes of this schedule, an asset is
to be reported as being in nonaccrual status if: (1) it is
maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the
ﬁnancial condition of the borrower, (2) payment in full of
principal or interest is not expected, or (3) principal or
interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or
more unless the asset is both well secured and in the
process of collection.
An asset is ‘‘well secured’’ if it is secured (1) by
collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or
personal property, including securities, that have a realiz-
able value sufficient to discharge the debt (including
accrued interest) in full, or (2) by the guarantee of a
ﬁnancially responsible party. An asset is ‘‘in the process
of collection’’ if collection of the asset is proceeding in
due course either (1) through legal action, including
judgment enforcement procedures, or, (2) in appropriate
circumstances, through collection efforts not involving
legal action which are reasonably expected to result in
repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current
status in the near future.
For purposes of applying the third test for nonaccrual
status listed above, the date on which an asset reaches
nonaccrual status is determined by its contractual terms.
If the principal or interest on an asset becomes due and
Schedule HC-N
HC-N-2
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-N
March 2024

unpaid for 90 days or more on a date that falls between
report dates, the asset should be placed in nonaccrual
status as of the date it becomes 90 days past due and it
should remain in nonaccrual status until it meets the
criteria for restoration to accrual status described below.
In the following situations, an asset need not be placed in
nonaccrual status:
(1) The asset upon which principal or interest is due and
unpaid for 90 days or more is a consumer loan (as
deﬁned for Schedule HC-C, item 6, ‘‘Loans to indi-
viduals for household, family, and other personal
expenditures’’) or a loan secured by a 1-to-4 family
residential property (as deﬁned for Schedule HC-C,
item 1(c), Loans ‘‘Secured by 1-4 family residential
properties’’). Nevertheless, such loans should be
subject to other alternative methods of evaluation to
assure that the holding company’s net income is not
materially overstated. To the extent that the holding
company has elected to carry such a loan in nonac-
crual status on its books, the loan must be reported as
nonaccrual in this schedule.
(2) The following criteria are met for a PCD asset,
including a PCD asset that was previously a PCI
asset or part of a pool of PCI assets, that would
otherwise be required to be placed in nonaccrual
status (see the Glossary entry for “Nonaccrual Sta-
tus”):
(a) The holding company reasonably estimates the
timing and amounts of cash ﬂows expected to be
collected, and
(b) The holding company did not acquire the asset
primarily for the rewards of ownership of the
underlying collateral, such as use of collateral in
operations of the holding company.” or improv-
ing the collateral for resale.
When a PCD asset that meets the criteria above is not
placed in nonaccrual status, the asset should be
subject to other alternative methods of evaluation to
ensure that the holding company’s net income is not
materially overstated. Further, regardless of whether
a PCD asset is in nonaccrual or accrual status, a
holding company is not permitted to accrete the
credit-related discount embedded in the purchase
price of such an asset that is attributable to the
acquirer’s assessment of expected credit losses as of
the date of acquisition (i.e., the contractual cash
ﬂows the acquirer did not expect to collect at acqui-
sition). Interest income should no longer be recog-
nized on a PCD asset to the extent that the net
investment in the asset would increase to an amount
greater than the payoff amount. If a holding company
is required or has elected to carry a PCD asset in
nonaccrual status, the asset must be reported as a
nonaccrual asset at its amortized cost basis (fair
value for a PCD available-for-sale debt security) in
Schedule HC-N, column C. (For PCD assets for
which the holding company has made a policy
election to maintain previously existing pools of PCI
loans upon adoption of ASC Topic 326, the determi-
nation of nonaccrual or accrual status should be
made at the pool level, not the individual asset level.)
For further information, see the Glossary entry for
“Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Assets.”
As a general rule, a nonaccrual asset may be restored to
accrual status when:
(1) None of its principal and interest is due and unpaid,
and the holding company expects repayment of the
remaining contractual principal and interest, or
(2) When it otherwise becomes well secured and in the
process of collection.
For purposes of meeting the ﬁrst test for restoration to
accrual status, the holding company must have received
repayment of the past due principal and interest unless, as
discussed in the Glossary entry for ‘‘Nonaccrual Status,’’
(1) The asset has been formally modiﬁed to a borrower
experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty and qualiﬁes for
accrual status,
(2) The asset is a purchased credit-impaired loan, pool of
loans, or debt security accounted for in accordance
with ASC Subtopic 310-30 and it meets the criteria
for accrual of income under the interest method
speciﬁed in that Subtopic,
(3) The borrower has resumed paying the full amount of
the scheduled contractual interest and principal pay-
ments on a loan that is past due and in nonaccrual
status, even though the loan has not been brought
fully current, and certain repayment criteria are met.
For further information, see the Glossary entry for “Non-
Accrual Status.”

item 9, above beyond the amount that has already been
reﬂected in the measurement of the reporting holding
company’s indemniﬁcation asset, which represents the
right to receive payments from the FDIC under the

In general, the maximum amount recoverable from the
FDIC on covered past due and nonaccrual loans and
leases is the recorded amount of these loans and leases, as
reported in Schedule HC-N, item 9 in the appropriate
column, multiplied by the currently applicable loss cov-
erage rate (e.g., 80 percent or 95 percent). This product
will normally be the maximum amount recoverable
because reimbursements from the FDIC for covered
losses related to the amount by which the ‘‘book value’’
of a covered asset on the failed institution’s books (which
is the amount upon which payments under an FDIC
loss-sharing agreement are based) exceeds the amount at
which the reporting holding company reports the covered
asset on Schedule HC, Balance Sheet, should already
have been taken into account in measuring the carrying
amount of the reporting holding company’s loss-sharing
indemniﬁcation asset, which is reported in Schedule
HC-F, item 6, “Other” assets.

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
1–4 Family Residential
Mortgage Banking Activities
Schedule HC-P
General Instructions
Schedule HC-P is to be completed by holding companies
with $5 billion on more in total assets where any of the
following residential mortgage banking activities (in
domestic offices) exceeds $10 million for two consecu-
tive quarters:
(a) Closed-end and open-end ﬁrst lien and junior lien 1-4
family residential mortgage loan originations and pur-
chases for resale from all sources during a calendar
quarter; or
(b) Closed-end and open-end ﬁrst lien and junior lien 1-4
family residential mortgage loan sales during a calendar
quarter; or
(c) Closed-end and open-end ﬁrst lien and junior lien 1-4
family residential mortgage loans held for sale and held
for trading at calendar quarter-end.
For purposes of measuring 1-4 family residential mort-
gage banking activities and reporting on these activities
in Schedule HC-P, holding companies should include
those 1-4 family residential mortgage loans that would be
reportable as held for sale as well as those that would be
reportable as held for trading.
A holding company must complete Schedule HC-P
beginning the second quarter in which the $10 million
threshold is exceeded and continue to complete the
schedule through the end of the calendar year. Open-end
mortgage banking activities should be measured using
the ’’total commitment under the lines of credit‘‘ as
deﬁned below. For example, if the holding company’s
closed-end and open-end ﬁrst and junior lien 1-4 family
residential mortgage loan originations and purchases for
resale from all sources exceeded $10 million during the
quarter ended June 30, 2017, and the holding company’s
sales of such loans exceeded $10 million during the
quarter ended September 30, 2017, the holding company
would be required to complete Schedule HC-P in its
September 30 and December 31, 2017, FR Y-9C reports.
The level of the holding companies mortgage banking
activities during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the ﬁrst
quarter of 2018 would determine whether it would need
to complete Schedule HC-P each quarter during 2018
beginning March 31, 2018.
For purposes of Schedule HC-P, closed-end 1-4 family
residential mortgage loans are deﬁned in Schedule HC-C,
item 1(c)(2), ‘‘Closed-end loans secured by 1-4 family
residential properties.’’ Open-end 1-4 family residential
mortgage loans are deﬁned in Schedule HC-C, item
1(c)(1), ’’Revolving, open-end loans secured by 1-4
family residential properties and extended under lines of
credit.‘‘ These Schedule HC-C deﬁnitions also apply to
closed-end and open-end 1-4 family residential mortgage
loans that would be reportable as held for trading in
Schedule HC-D and in Schedule HC, item 5, ‘‘Trading
assets.’’
For purposes of reporting on open-end loans extended
under lines of credit in Schedule HC-P, the ‘‘total com-
mitment under the lines of credit’’ is deﬁned as the total
amount of the lines of credit granted to customers at the
time the open-end credits were originated. For retail and
wholesale originations of such open-end loans, the
’’principal amount funded under the lines of credit‘‘ is
deﬁned as the initial fundings made to customers on
newly established lines of credit. For open-end loans
purchased, sold, held for sale, and repurchased or indem-
niﬁed, the ‘‘principal amount funded under the lines of
credit’’ is deﬁned as the principal balance outstanding of
loans extended under lines of credit at the transaction
date or at quarter-end, as appropriate.
Line Item 1
Retail originations during the quarter
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans for sale.
Report the total of:

ending on the report date, and
• The total amount of open-end commitments under

Include as retail originations those closed-end and open-
end 1-4 family residential mortgage loans for which the
origination and underwriting process was handled exclu-
sively by the holding company or a consolidated subsid-
iary of the holding company. However, if the reporting
holding company is acting merely as a broker or agent
and forwards loan applications and supporting documen-
tation to another party who closes or funds the loans in its
name (even if the reporting holding company has some
involvement in processing and underwriting the loans),
the reporting holding company should not report these
loans as originations or purchases in this schedule.
Exclude closed-end and open-end 1-4 family residential
mortgage loans originated or purchased for the reporting
holding company’s own loan portfolio.
Line Item 2
Wholesale originations and purchases
during the quarter of 1-4 family residential

closed-end and open-end 1-4 family residential mortgage
loans for resale for which the origination and underwrit-
ing process was handled in whole or in part by another
party, such as a correspondent or mortgage broker, even
if the loan was closed in the name of the holding
company or a consolidated subsidiary of the holding
company (often referred to as “table funding arrange-
ments”). Also include acquisitions of closed-end and
open-end 1-4 family residential mortgage loans for resale
that were closed in the name of a party other than the
holding company or a consolidated subsidiary of the
holding company. However, if the reporting holding
company is acting merely as a broker or agent and
forwards loan applications and supporting documentation
to another party who closes or funds the loans in its name
(even if the reporting holding company has some involve-
ment in processing and underwriting the loans), the
reporting holding company should not report these loans
as originations or purchases in this schedule.

mortgage loans originated or purchased for the reporting
holding company’s own loan portfolio.

of the consolidated holding company’s “Trading rev-
enue,” “Net servicing fees,” “Net securitization income,”

(items 5(c), 5(f), 5(g), and 5(i) of Schedule HI) earned
during the quarter that is attributable to closed-end and
open-end 1-4 family residential mortgage loans.
Line Item 6
Repurchases and indemniﬁcations of
1-4 family residential mortgage loans during the
quarter.
As a result of its 1-4 family residential mortgage banking
activities, a holding company may be obligated to repur-
chase mortgage loans that it has sold or otherwise
indemnify the loan purchaser against loss because of
borrower defaults, loan defects, other breaches of repre-
sentations and warranties, or for other reasons.
Report the total of:
• The total principal amount outstanding as of the date of
repurchase or the date of indemniﬁcation, as appropri-
ate, of closed-end ﬁrst lien and junior lien 1-4 family
residential mortgage loans previously sold by the bank
or a consolidated subsidiary subject to an obligation to
repurchase or indemnify that have been repurchased or
indemniﬁed during the calendar quarter ending on the
report date, and
• The total amount of open-end commitments under
revolving, open-end lines of credit secured by 1-4
family residential properties as of the date of repur-
chase or the date of indemniﬁcation, as appropriate,
that have been repurchased or indemniﬁed during the
calendar quarter ending on the report date.
Do not reduce this amount by any third-party indemniﬁ-
cations or reimbursements that the holding company has
received.
Repurchased 1-4 family residential mortgage loans
include loans that the holding company (or a consoli-
dated subsidiary) had sold but subsequently repurchased
under repurchase obligation provisions of the sales agree-
ment because of a delinquency, noncompliance with the
sellers’ representations and warranties, fraud or misrep-
resentation, or any other contractual requirement. Exclude
1-4 family residential mortgage loans that have been
repurchased solely at the discretion of the holding com-
pany (such as delinquent mortgage loans backing GNMA
mortgage-backed securities), i.e., where the sales agree-
ment contains a repurchase option (which may be condi-
tional), but not a repurchase obligation.
Indemniﬁcations of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans
are limited to reimbursements to loan purchasers or other
third parties for credit losses on loans that the holding
company (or a consolidated subsidiary) has sold. Include
reimbursements made on loans where the holding com-
pany has agreed with the purchaser or other third party
not to repurchase the loan as required under the sales
agreement, but rather to guarantee that no credit loss is
sustained. Indemniﬁcations also include loans for which
payments have been made by the holding company (or a
consolidated subsidiary) to purchasers or other third
parties as reimbursements for deﬁciency balances arising
from sales of real estate collateral (whether or not
foreclosed) on loans that the holding company (or a
consolidated subsidiary) has sold. Exclude indemniﬁca-
tion arrangements that are limited to reimbursements of
legal fees or administrative costs.
Line Item 7

Schedule HC-P
FR Y-9C
HC-P-3
Schedule HC-P

the investors or other purchasers of the loans at the time
of the sale and to ﬁnancial guarantors of the loans sold.
The speciﬁc representations and warranties may relate to
the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing
the loan, and the loan’s compliance with speciﬁed under-
writing standards. Under ASC Subtopic 450-20, Contin-
gencies - Loss Contingencies (formerly FASB Statement
No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”), an institution is
required to accrue loss contingencies relating to the
representations and warranties made in connection with
their mortgage securitization activities and mortgage loan
sales when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and
the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Report in the appropriate subitem the amount of represen-
tation and warranty reserves included in Schedule HC-G,
“Other liabilities,” that the institution maintains for 1-4
family residential mortgage loans sold, including those
mortgage loans transferred in securitizations accounted
for as sales.
Amounts reported in Schedule HC-P, items 7(a) and 7(b),
will not be made available to the public on an individual

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Assets and Liabilities Measured at
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Schedule HC-Q
General Instructions
Schedule HC-Q is required to be completed only by
holding companies with $5 billion on more in total assets
that:
(1) Have elected to report ﬁnancial instruments or servic-
ing assets and liabilities at fair value under a fair
value option with changes in fair value recognized in
earnings or
(2) Are required to complete Schedule HC-D, Trading
Assets and Liabilities, i.e., reported total trading
assets of $10 million or more in any of the four
preceding calendar quarters.
Your holding company is not required to complete Sched-
ule HC-Q if the only ﬁnancial instruments that your
holding company measures at fair value in the ﬁnancial
statements on a recurring basis are:
(1) Available-for-sale debt securities (reported in Sched-
ule HC, item 2.b), and
(2) Equity securities with readily determinable fair val-
ues not held for trading (reported in Schedule HC,
item 2.c), and
(3) Equity securities and other equity investments that do
not have readily determinable fair values that your
holding company measures at fair value (i.e., equity
securities and other equity investments that do not
have readily determinable values that your holding
company has not elected to measure at cost minus
impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting
from observable price changes in orderly transactions
for the identical or a similar investment of the same
issuer) (reported in Schedule HC, item 9, or Sched-
ule HC-F, item 4, as appropriate).
A holding company that is required to complete Sched-
ule HC-Q should report all assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value in the ﬁnancial statements on a
recurring basis. Exclude from Schedule HC-Q those
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis. Recurring fair value measurement of
assets or liabilities are those fair value measurements that
applicable accounting standards and these instructions
require or permit in the balance sheet at the end of each
reporting period. In contrast, nonrecurring fair value
measurements of asset or liabilities are those fair value
measurements that applicable accounting standards and
these instructions require or permit in the balance sheet in
particular circumstances (for example, when an institu-
tion subsequently measures foreclosed real estate at the

Column Instructions
Column A, Total Fair Value Reported on Schedule HC
Report in Column A the total fair value, as deﬁned by
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, of those
assets and liabilities reported on Schedule HC, Balance
Sheet, that the holding company reports at fair value on a
recurring basis.
Columns B through E, Fair Value Measurements and
Netting Adjustments
For items reported in Column A, report in Columns C, D,
and E the fair value amounts which fall in their entirety in
Levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The level in the fair value
hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its
entirety falls should be determined based on the lowest
level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measure-
ment in its entirety. Thus, for example, if the fair value of
an asset or liability has elements of both Level 2 and
Level 3 measurement inputs, report the entire fair value
of the asset or liability in Column D or Column E based
on the lowest level measurement input with the most
signiﬁcance to the fair value of the asset or liability in its
entirety as described in ASC Topic 820. For assets and
liabilities that the holding company has netted under
FR Y-9C
HC-Q-1
Schedule HC-Q
December 2020

legally enforceable master netting agreements in accor-
dance with ASC Subtopic 210-20, Balance Sheet–
Offsetting, report the gross amounts in Columns C, D,
and E and the related netting adjustment in Column B.
For more information on Level 1, 2, and 3 measurement
inputs, see the Glossary entry for “fair value.”
ASC Topic 820 permits a holding company, as a practical
expedient, to measure the fair value of investments in
investment companies and real estate funds that meet
criteria speciﬁed in this topic using the investment’s net
asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent). When a
holding company has elected to measure the fair value of
such an investment using the NAV per share practical
expedient and the fair value is measured on a recurring
basis, the holding company should report the invest-
ment’s fair value in column A of the appropriate asset
item of Schedule HC-Q. However, the holding company
should exclude the investment from the Level 1, 2, and 3
disclosures in columns C, D, and E of Schedule HC-Q.1
Instead, the holding company should report the fair value
measured using the NAV per share practical expedient in
column B along with the netting adjustments reported in
column B. In contrast, for an investment measured at fair
value on a recurring basis that meets the criteria speciﬁed
in Topic 820, if the holding company does not elect to
measure fair value using the NAV per share practical
expedient, it should report the investment’s fair value in
column A of Schedule HC-Q and disclose this fair value
in column C, D, or E, as appropriate, based on the lowest
level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measure-
ment in its entirety.

Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR)
Framework:
Opt-in to the CBLR framework
A qualifying holding company may opt in to use the
CBLR framework. Qualifying holding companies opt
into and out of the CBLR framework through their
FR Y-9C. A qualifying holding company that opts into
the CBLR framework (electing holding company) must
complete Schedule HC-R, Part I, items 1 through 36, and
can make that election on Schedule HC-R, Part I,
item 31.a. A qualifying holding company can opt out of
the CBLR framework by completing Schedule HC-R,
Part I and Part II, excluding Schedule HC-R, Part I,
items 32 through 36. However, the Board may disallow
an otherwise qualifying holding company use of the
CBLR framework based on the Board’s evaluation of the
risk proﬁle of the holding company.
On April 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies pub-
lished two interim ﬁnal rules to provide temporary relief
to community banking organizations with respect to the
CBLR framework, and the ﬁnal rule became effective
November 9, 2020, with no changes to the interim ﬁnal
rules. The ﬁnal rule provides community banking organi-
zations with a clear and gradual transition, by January 1,
2022, back to the greater than 9 percent leverage ratio
qualifying criterion previously established by the agen-
cies. The other qualifying criteria in the CBLR frame-
work have not been modiﬁed by the ﬁnal rule.
A qualifying holding company with a leverage ratio that
exceeds the applicable leverage ratio requirement and
opts into the CBLR framework shall be considered to
have met: (i) the generally applicable risk-based and
leverage capital requirements in the agencies’ capital
rules; (ii) the capital ratio requirements to be considered
1. Category III holding company include institutions, which are not
advanced approaches holding companies, that have (1) at least $250 billion
in average total consolidated assets or (2) at least $100 billion in average
total consolidated assets and at least $75 billion in average total nonbank
assets, average weighted short-term wholesale funding; or average off-
balance sheet exposure.
2. A holding company that is subject to the advanced approaches capital
rule (i.e., an advanced approaches institution as deﬁned in the Board’s
capital rules) is (i) global systemically important bank holding company, as
identiﬁed pursuant to 12 CFR 217.402; (ii) a Category II institution; (iii) is
a subsidiary of a holding company that uses the advanced approaches
pursuant to 12 CFR part 217 (Board) to calculate its risk-based capital
requirements; or (iv) a holding company that elects to use the advanced
approaches to calculate its risk-based capital requirements.
Category II institutions include institutions with (1) at least $700 billion
in total consolidated assets or (2) at least $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional
activity and at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets. In addition,
depository institution subsidiaries of Category II institutions are consid-
ered Category II institutions.

Transition Provisions — Under the provisions of the
transition interim ﬁnal rule, a holding company may
qualify for the CBLR framework if its leverage ratio is
greater than 8.5 percent in calendar year 2021, and
greater than 9 percent in calendar year 2022 and thereaf-
ter, and it meets the qualifying criteria: it has less than
$10 billion in total consolidated assets (Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 32); is not part of an advanced approaches
banking organization; has total trading assets and trading
liabilities of 5 percent or less of total consolidated assets
(Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 33); and has total off-
balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than
sold credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable
commitments) of 25 percent or less of total consolidated
assets (Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 34). Also, the
two-quarter grace period for a qualifying holding com-
pany will take into account the graduated increase in the
community bank leverage ratio requirement qualifying
criterion. In order to maintain eligibility for the CBLR
framework during the transition period, a holding com-
pany’s leverage ratio cannot fall more than one percent-
age point below the community bank leverage ratio
requirement qualifying criterion.

Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) Framework in
Calendar Year 2022 and Thereafter
In general, a holding company may qualify for the CBLR
framework if its leverage ratio is greater than 9 percent
(as reported in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 31); it has
less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets (Sched-
ule HC-R, Part I, item 32); is not an advanced approaches
holding company; has total trading assets and trading
liabilities of 5 percent or less of total consolidated assets
(Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 33); and has total off-
balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than
sold credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable
commitments) of 25 percent or less of total consolidated
assets (Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 34).
Ceasing to Meet the Leverage Ratio Requirement under
the CBLR Framework or Failing to Meet any of the
Other CBLR Qualifying Criteria
A qualifying holding company that temporarily fails to
meet any of the qualifying criteria, including the applica-
ble leverage ratio requirement, generally would still be
deemed well-capitalized so long as the holding company
maintains a leverage ratio that does not fall more than
one percentage point below the leverage ratio require-
ment during the two-quarter grace period. At the end of
the grace period (see below for an example), the holding
company must meet all qualifying criteria to remain in
the CBLR framework or otherwise must apply and report
under the generally applicable rule. Similarly, a holding
company with a leverage ratio that is not within one
percentage point of the leverage ratio requirement quali-
fying criterion under the CBLR framework is not eligible
for the grace period and must comply with the generally
applicable rule, by completing all of Schedule HC-R,
Parts I and II, as applicable, excluding HC-R, Part I,
items 32 through 36.
Under the CBLR framework, the grace period will begin
as of the end of the calendar quarter in which the CBLR
electing holding company ceases to satisfy any of the
qualifying criteria and has a maximum period of two
consecutive calendar quarters. For example, if the CBLR
electing holding company had met all of the qualifying
criteria as of March 31, 2020, but no longer meets one of
the qualifying criteria as of May 15, 2020, and still does
not meet the criteria as of the end of that quarter, the
grace period for such a holding company will begin as of
the end of the quarter ending June 30, 2020. The holding
company may continue to use the CBLR framework as of
September 30, 2020, but will need to comply fully with
the generally applicable capital rule (including the asso-
ciated reporting requirements) as of December 31, 2020,
unless the holding company once again meets all qualify-
ing criteria of the CBLR framework, including the lever-
age ratio, had met all of the qualifying criteria as of
March 31, 2020, but before that time.

HC-R-2
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-R
March 2022

If a CBLR electing holding company is in the grace
period when the required community bank leverage ratio
increases, the holding company would be subject, as of
the date of that change, to both the higher community
bank leverage ratio requirement and higher grace period
leverage ratio requirement. For example, if a CBLR
electing holding company that had met all of the qualify-
ing criteria as of September 30, 2020, has a 7.2 percent
community bank leverage ratio (but meets all of the other
qualifying criteria) as of December 31, 2020, the grace
period for such an holding company will begin as of the
end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The holding company
may continue to use the CBLR framework as of March 31,
2021, if the holding company has a leverage ratio of
greater than 7.5 percent, and will need to comply fully
with the generally applicable capital rule (including the
associated Schedule HC-R reporting requirements) as of
June 30, 2021, unless the holding company has a lever-
age ratio of greater than 8.5 percent (and meets all of the
other qualifying criteria) by that date. In this example, if
the holding company has a leverage ratio equal to or less
than 7.5 percent as of March 31, 2021, it would not be
eligible to use the CBLR framework and would be
subject immediately to the requirements of the generally
applicable capital rule.
3-Year and 5-Year 2020 CECL Transition Provisions
In 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a ﬁnal rule
that, among other provisions, revised the agencies’ regu-
latory capital rule and included a transition option that
allows holding companies to phase in over a 3-year
transition period the day-one effects of adopting the
current expected credit losses methodology (CECL) on
their regulatory capital ratios (2019 CECL rule).
In 2020, the agencies issued a ﬁnal rule that provides
holding companies that implement CECL during the
2020 calendar year the option to delay for two years an
estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative
to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory
capital, followed by a 3-year transition period, thereby
resulting in a 5-year transition period (2020 CECL rule).
Eligibility for, and Transition Period under, the 3-Year
CECL Transition
A holding company is eligible to use the 3-Year CECL
transition provision if it experiences a reduction in
retained earnings due to CECL adoption as of the begin-
ning of the ﬁscal year in which the holding company
adopts CECL. The transition period under the 3-year
CECL transition provision means the three-year period
beginning the ﬁrst day of the ﬁscal year in which a
holding company adopts CECL and reﬂects CECL in its
ﬁrst FR Y-9C ﬁled after that date.
A holding company that is eligible to use the 3-year
CECL transition provision may elect to phase in the
regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL over a
3-year transition period (a 3-year CECL electing holding
company). A 3-year CECL electing holding company is
required to begin applying the 3-year CECL transition
provision as of the electing holding company’s CECL
adoption date. A 3-year CECL electing holding company
must indicate in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 2.a, its
election to use the 3-year CECL transition provision and
must report the transitional amounts, as deﬁned below
and as applicable, in the affected items of Sched-
ule HC-R, adjusted for the transition provisions, begin-
ning in the FR Y-9C for the quarter in which the holding
company ﬁrst reports its credit loss allowances as mea-
sured under CECL.
A holding company that does not elect to use the 3-year
CECL transition provision in the FR Y-9C for the quarter
in which it ﬁrst reports its credit loss allowances as
measured under CECL is not permitted to make an
election in subsequent reporting periods and is required
to reﬂect the full effect of CECL in its regulatory capital
ratios beginning as of the holding company’s CECL
adoption date.
A holding company that initially elects to use the 3-year
CECL transition provision, but opts out of this transition
provision in a subsequent reporting period, is not permit-
ted to resume using the 3-year CECL transition provision
at a later date within the 3-year transition period. A
holding company may opt out of applying the transition
provision by reﬂecting the full impact of CECL on
regulatory capital in FR Y-9C Schedule HC-R.
Eligibility for the 5-Year 2020 CECL Transition
A holding company is eligible to use the 5-Year
2020 CECL transition provision if it adopts CECL under
U.S. GAAP as of the ﬁrst day of a ﬁscal year that begins
during the 2020 calendar year and:
(1) Reports a decrease in retained earnings immediately
upon adoption of CECL; or
(2) Would report a positive modiﬁed CECL transitional
amount (as deﬁned below) in any quarter ending in
2020 after adopting CECL.
Schedule HC-R
FR Y-9C
HC-R-3
Schedule HC-R
March 2021

A holding company must indicate in Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 2.a, its election to use the 5-year 2020 CECL
transition provision in calendar year 2020 in the ﬁrst
FR Y-9C ﬁled after the holding company adopts CECL
or the same FR Y-9C in which the holding company ﬁrst
reports a positive modiﬁed CECL transitional amount for
any calendar quarter ending in 2020 (5-year CECL
electing holding company).
Even if a holding company elects to use the 5-Year
2020 CECL transition provision, the holding company
may only reﬂect the regulatory capital adjustments set
forth in the 2020 CECL rule in the quarter or quarters in
which the holding company implements CECL for regu-
latory reporting purposes. A holding company that has
elected the 5-year 2020 CECL transition provision, but
would not report a positive modiﬁed CECL transitional
amount in a particular quarter, is not required to make the
adjustments in FR Y-9C Schedule HC-R in that quarter.
Transition Period under the 5-Year 2020 CECL
Transition—Beginning with the earlier of:
(1) The ﬁrst quarter of the ﬁscal year in which a holding
company was required to adopt CECL under
U.S. GAAP (as in effect on January 1, 2020), or
(2) The ﬁrst day of a ﬁscal year that begins in the 2020
calendar year in which the holding company ﬁles the
FR Y-9C reﬂecting CECL, and for the subsequent
19 quarters (for a total of 20 quarters or the ﬁve-year
transition period), a holding company is permitted to
make the adjustments described below to amounts
used in calculating regulatory capital. If a holding
company temporarily ceases using CECL during this
period (i.e., due to election of Section 4014 of the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
(CARES Act)), the holding company may not reﬂect
regulatory capital adjustments for any quarter (dur-
ing the ﬁrst 8 quarters) in which it did not implement
CECL, but it would be allowed to apply the transi-
tion in subsequent quarters when the holding com-
pany uses CECL. However, a holding company that
has elected the transition, but does not apply it in any
quarter, does not receive any extension of the transi-
tion period.
Example 1: A holding company was required to adopt
CECL on January 1, 2020. This holding company, how-
ever, delays adoption of CECL under Section 4014 of the
CARES Act until July 1, 2020, and elects to use the
5-Year 2020 CECL transition provision. This holding
company’s transition period begins on January 1, 2020,
despite not adopting CECL until July 1, 2020. As such,
on July 1, 2020, this holding company would have
18 quarters,4 including the quarter of adoption, remaining
in its transition period.
Example 2: A holding company was required to adopt
CECL on October 1, 2020, and elects to use the 5-Year
2020 CECL transition provision. This holding company
does not delay adoption of CECL under Section 4014 of
the CARES Act. This holding company’s transition
period begins on October 1, 2020. As such, on October 1,
2020, this holding company would have 20 quarters,
including the quarter of adoption, remaining in its transi-
tion period.
For the ﬁrst 8 quarters after the start of its transition
period, a holding company is permitted to make an
adjustment of 100 percent of the transitional items calcu-
lated below for each quarter in which the holding com-
pany applies CECL. Beginning with the ninth quarter of
the transition period, the holding company phases out the
cumulative adjustment as calculated at the end of the
eighth quarter (i.e., the ﬁrst two years of the 5-Year
2020 CECL transition provision) over the following
12 quarters as follows: 75 percent adjustment in quar-
ters 9-12 (i.e., Year three); 50 percent adjustment in
quarters 13-16 (i.e., Year four); and 25 percent adjust-
ment in quarters 17-20 (i.e., Year ﬁve).
Deﬁnitions - Holding companies that elect either the
3-year
CECL
transition
provision
or
the
5-year
2020 CECL transition provision must calculate the fol-
lowing amounts, as applicable. AACL refers to Adjusted
Allowances for Credit Losses as deﬁned in the regulatory
capital rule 12 CFR 217.2 (Board).
• CECL transitional amount means the difference, net of
any deferred tax assets (DTAs), in the amount of a
holding company’s retained earnings as of the begin-
ning of the ﬁscal year in which the holding company
adopts CECL from the amount of the holding com-
pany’s retained earnings as of the closing of the ﬁscal
yearend immediately prior to the holding company’s
adoption of CECL.
• DTA transitional amount means the difference in the
amount of a holding company’s DTAs arising from
temporary differences as of the beginning of the ﬁscal

year in which the holding company adopts CECL from
the amount of the holding company’s DTAs arising
from temporary differences as of the closing of the
ﬁscal year-end immediately prior to the holding com-
pany’s adoption of CECL.
• AACL transitional amount means the difference in the
amount of a holding company’s AACL as of the
beginning of the ﬁscal year in which the holding
company adopts CECL and the amount of the holding
company’s ALLL as of the closing of the ﬁscal year-
end immediately prior to the holding company’s adop-
tion of CECL.
• Eligible credit reserves transitional amount means the
difference in the amount of an advanced approaches
holding company’s eligible credit reserves as of the
beginning of the ﬁscal year in which the holding
company adopts CECL from the amount of the holding
company’s eligible credit reserves as of the closing of
the ﬁscal year-end immediately prior to the holding
company’s adoption of CECL.
In addition, holding companies that elect the 5-year 2020
CECL transition provision must calculate the following
amounts:
• Modiﬁed CECL transitional amount means:
– During the ﬁrst two years of the transition period,
the difference between the AACL as reported in the
most recent FR Y-9C, and the AACL as of the
beginning of the ﬁscal year in which the holding
company adopts CECL, multiplied by 0.25, plus the
CECL transitional amount, and
– During the last three years of the transition period,
the difference between the AACL as reported in the
FR Y-9C at the end of the second year of the
transition period and the AACL as of the beginning
of the ﬁscal year in which the holding company
adopts CECL, multiplied by 0.25, plus the CECL
transitional amount.
• Modiﬁed AACL transitional amount means:
– During the ﬁrst two years of the transition period,
the difference between the AACL as reported in the
most recent FR Y-9C, and the AACL as of the
beginning of the ﬁscal year in which the holding
company adopts CECL, multiplied by 0.25, plus the
AACL transitional amount, and
– During the last three years of the transition period,
the difference between the AACL as reported in the
FR Y-9C at the end of the second year of the
transition period and the AACL as of the beginning
of the ﬁscal year in which the holding company
adopts CECL, multiplied by 0.25, plus the AACL
transitional amount.
A 3-year or 5-year CECL electing advanced approaches
holding company (1) that has completed the parallel run
process and has received notiﬁcation from the Board of
the regulatory capital rules, (2) whose amount of expected
credit loss exceeded its eligible credit reserves immedi-
ately prior to the adoption of CECL, and (3) would have
an increase in common equity tier 1 capital as of the
beginning of the ﬁscal year in which it adopts CECL after
including the ﬁrst year portion of the CECL transitional
amount or modiﬁed CECL transitional amount, as appli-
cable, must decrease its CECL transitional amount or
modiﬁed CECL transitional amount, as applicable, by its
DTA transitional amount.
Example and a Worksheet Calculation for the 3-year
CECL Transition Provision:
Assumptions:
• For example, consider a holding company that elects to
apply the 3-year CECL transition and has a CECL
effective date of January 1, 2020, and a 21 percent tax
rate.
• On the closing balance sheet date immediately prior to
adopting CECL (i.e., December 31, 2019), the 3-year
CECL electing holding company has $10 million in
retained earnings and $1 million in the allowance for
loan and lease losses. On the opening balance sheet
date immediately after adopting CECL (i.e., January 1,
2020), the 3-year CECL electing holding company has
$1.2 million in allowances for credit losses (ACL),
which also equals $1.2 million of AACL, as deﬁned in
the regulatory capital rules.
• The 3-year CECL electing holding company recog-
nizes the effect of the adoption of CECL as of Janu-
ary 1, 2020, by recording an increase in its ACL
of $200,000 (credit), with an offsetting increase in
temporary difference DTAs of $42,000 (debit) and a
reduction in beginning retained earnings of $158,000
(debit).
• For each of the quarterly reporting periods in year 1 of
the transition period (i.e., 2020), the 3-year CECL

June 2021

electing holding company increases both retained earn-
ings and average total consolidated assets by $118,500
($158,000 x 75 percent), decreases temporary differ-
ence DTAs by $31,500 ($42,000 x 75 percent), and
decreases AACL by $150,000 ($200,000 x 75 percent)
for purposes of calculating its regulatory capital ratios.
The remainder of the 3-year CECL transition provision
of the 3-year CECL electing holding company is
transitioned into regulatory capital according to the
schedule provided in Table 2 below.
Example of Application of the 5-Year CECL Transition
Provision for Third Quarter 2020
As an example, assume a holding company is required
under U.S. GAAP to adopt CECL on January 1, 2020.
This holding company chose not to delay adoption of
CECL for FR Y-9C purposes under the provisions of
Section 4014 of the CARES Act, and elected to use the
5-year 2020 CECL transition provision in the March 31,
2020, FR Y-9C. This holding company’s 5-year
2020 CECL transition period begins on January 1, 2020.
The holding company’s December 31, 2019, FR Y-9C
reﬂected the following amounts:
• ALLL: $120
• Temporary Difference DTAs: $20
• Retained earnings: $200
• Eligible credit reserves (advanced approaches holding
companies only): $110
On January 1, 2020, the holding company adopted CECL
and reﬂected the following amounts:
• AACL: $150
• AACL transitional amount = $150 - $120 = $30
(AACL on 1/1/20 – ALLL on 12/31/19)
• Temporary difference DTAs: $30
• DTA transitional amount = $30 - $20 = $10 (DTAs on
1/1/20 – DTAs on 12/31/19)
• Retained earnings: $180
• CECL transitional amount = $200 - $180 = $20
(Retained earnings on 12/31/19 – retained earnings on
1/1/20)
• Eligible credit reserves (advanced approaches holding
companies only): $140
• Eligible credit reserves transitional amount (advanced
approaches holding companies only) =
$140 - $110 = $30
(Eligible credit reserves on 1/1/20 – eligible credit
reserves on 12/31/19)
On September 30, 2020, the holding company reﬂected
the following amounts:
• AACL: $170
• Modiﬁed
AACL
transitional
amount
=
($170-
$150)*0.25 + $30 = $35

The holding company would adjust the following items
in its September 30, 2020, FR Y-9C, Schedule HC-R:
• Part I, Item 2 (Retained earnings): Add $25 (modiﬁed

framework in its September 30, 2020, FR Y-9C, would
make these additional Schedule HC-R adjustments:
• Part I, Item 40.a (Allowances in tier 2 capital): Sub-
tract $35 (modiﬁed AACL transitional amount)
• Part II, Item 8 (All other assets): Subtract $10 (DTA

A holding company subject to the supplementary lever-
age ratio (advanced approaches and Category III holding
companies) would make this additional Schedule HC-R
adjustment in its September 30, 2020, FR Y-9C:
• Part I, Item 53 (Total leverage exposure for SLR):
Add $25 (modiﬁed CECL transitional amount)
A holding company subject to the advanced approaches
capital rule that has exited parallel run would make this
additional Schedule HC-R adjustment in its Septem-
ber 30, 2020, FR Y-9C:
• Part I, Item 40.b (Eligible credit reserves): Deduct $30
(eligible credit reserves transitional amount)
Advanced approaches holding companies
Advanced approaches holding companies may use the
amounts reported in Schedule HC-R, Part I to complete
FFIEC 101, Schedule A, as applicable. As described in
the General Instructions for FFIEC 101, a holding com-
pany must begin reporting on the FFIEC 101, Schedule
A, except for a few speciﬁc line items, at the end of the
quarter after the quarter in which a holding company
triggers one of the threshold criteria for applying the
advanced approaches rule or elects to use the advanced
approaches rule (an opt-in holding company),5 and it
must begin reporting data on the remaining schedules of
the FFIEC 101 at the end of the ﬁrst quarter in which it
has begun its parallel run period.
Advanced approaches holding companies must continue
to ﬁle Schedule HC-R, Regulatory Capital, as well as the
FFIEC 101.
SLHCs: The revised regulatory capital rules apply to
top-tier SLHCs that are not substantially engaged in
insurance or commercial activities (covered SLHCs).
A top-tier SLHC is deemed to be substantially engaged in
insurance activities (insurance SLHC) if (i) the top-tier
SLHC is an insurance underwriting company;6 or (ii) as
of June 30 of the previous calendar year, it held 25
percent or more of its total consolidated assets in subsid-
iaries that are insurance underwriting companies (other
than assets associated with insurance for credit risk). For
purposes of determining the 25 percent threshold, the
SLHC must calculate its total consolidated assets in
accordance with generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP), or if the SLHC does not calculate its total
consolidated assets under GAAP for any regulatory
purpose (including compliance with applicable securities
laws), the SLHC may estimate its total consolidated
assets, subject to review and adjustment by the Board.
Thus, insurance SLHCs are not required to complete
Schedule HC-R, even if they complete other schedules of
the FR Y-9C.
A top-tier SLHC is deemed to be substantially engaged in
commercial activities (commercial SLHC) if (i) the top-
tier SLHC is a grandfathered unitary SLHC (as deﬁned in
section 10(c)(9)(A) of HOLA) and (ii) as of June 30 of
the previous calendar year, it derived 50 percent or more
of its total consolidated assets or 50 percent of its total
revenues on an enterprise-wide basis (as calculated under
GAAP) from activities that are not ﬁnancial in nature
5. A holding company is deemed to have elected to use the advanced
approaches rule on the date that the Board receives from the holding
company a board-approved implementation plan pursuant to section
121(b)(2) of the revised regulatory capital rules. After that date, in addition
to being required to report on the FFIEC 101, Schedule A, the holding
company may no longer apply the AOCI opt-out election in section
22(b)(2) of the regulatory capital rules and it becomes subject to the
supplementary leverage ratio in section 10(c)(4).
6. Insurance underwriting company means an insurance company as
deﬁned in section 201 of the Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. 5381) that
engages in insurance underwriting activities.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital
Line Item 1
Common stock plus related surplus,
net of treasury stock and unearned employee stock
ownership plan (ESOP) shares.
Report the sum of Schedule HC, items 24, 25 and
item 26(c) as follows:
(1) Common stock: report the amount of common stock
reported in Schedule HC, item 24, provided it meets
the criteria for common equity tier 1 capital based on
the revised regulatory capital rules of the Board.
Include capital instruments issued by mutual banking
organizations that meet the criteria for common
equity tier 1 capital.
(2) Related surplus: adjust the amount reported in Sched-
ule HC, item 25 as follows: include the net amount
formally transferred to the surplus account, including
capital contributions, and any amount received for
common stock in excess of its par or stated value on
or before the report date; exclude adjustments arising
from treasury stock transactions.
(3) Treasury stock, unearned ESOP shares, and any
other contra-equity components: report the amount of
contra-equity components reported as negative
amounts in Schedule HC, item 26(c). Because contra-
equity components reduce equity capital, the amount
reported in Schedule HC, item 26(c), is a negative
amount.
Line Item 2
Retained earnings.
Report the amount of the holding company’s retained
earnings as reported in Schedule HC, item 26(a).
A holding company that has elected to apply the 3-year
CECL transition provision (3-year CECL electing hold-
ing company) should also include its applicable CECL
transitional amount, in accordance with section 301 of
the regulatory capital rules. Speciﬁcally, a 3-year CECL
electing holding company should increase retained earn-
ings by 75 percent of its CECL transitional amount
during the ﬁrst year of the transition period, 50 percent of
its CECL transitional amount during the second year of
the transition period, and 25 percent of its CECL transi-
tional amount during the third year of the transition
period.
A holding company that has elected to apply the 5-year
2020 CECL transition provision (5-year CECL electing
holding company) should also include in this item its
applicable modiﬁed CECL transitional amount in accor-
dance with section 301 of the regulatory capital rules.
Speciﬁcally, a 5-year CECL electing holding company
should increase retained earnings by 100 percent of its
modiﬁed CECL transitional amount during the ﬁrst and
second years of the transition period, 75 percent of its
modiﬁed CECL transitional amount during the third year
of the transition period, 50 percent of its modiﬁed CECL
transitional amount during the fourth year of the transi-
tion period, and 25 percent of its modiﬁed CECL transi-
tional amount during the ﬁfth year of the transition
period.
A 3-year or 5-year CECL electing advanced approaches
holding company (1) that has completed the parallel run
process and has received notiﬁcation from the Board
pursuant to section 121(d) under subpart E of the regula-
tory capital rules, (2) whose amount of expected credit
loss exceeded its eligible credit reserves immediately
prior to the adoption of CECL, and (3) would have an
increase in CET1 capital as of the beginning of the ﬁscal
year in which it adopts CECL after including the ﬁrst
year portion of the CECL transitional amount or modiﬁed
CECL transitional amount, as applicable, must decrease
its CECL transitional amount or modiﬁed CECL transi-
tional amount, as applicable, by its DTA transitional
amount.

transition provisions, see the General Instructions for
Schedule HC-R, Part I.
2.a
Does your institution have a CECL transition
election in effect as of the quarter-end report date? A
holding company may make a one-time election to use
the 3-year CECL transition provision (a 3-year CECL
electing holding company) or the 5-year 2020 CECL
transition provision (a 5-year CECL electing holding
company), as described in section 301 of the regulatory
capital rules, and in the General Instructions for Sched-
ule HC-R, Part I.

company ﬁles that includes CECL after the holding
company is required to use CECL for regulatory report-
ing purposes would not be permitted to make an election
to use the 3-year or the 5-year 2020 CECL transition
provision in subsequent reporting periods.7 For example,
a holding company that adopts CECL as of January 1,
2020 (i.e., does not delay adoption of CECL under
Section 4014 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act), records a reduction in retained
earnings due to the adoption of CECL, and does not elect
to use the CECL transition provision in its FR Y-9C
report for the March 31, 2020, report date would not be
permitted to use the 3-year or the 5-year 2020 CECL
transition provision in any subsequent reporting period.
A holding company would report whether it is using a
CECL transition election, as deﬁned in Section 301 of the
agencies’ regulatory capital rules, in the FR Y-9C report
for the current quarter. The holding company can choose
from the following entries: 0 = No; 1 = Yes with a 3-year
CECL transition election; and 2 = Yes with a 5-year
2020 CECL transition election. A holding company that
has elected the 5-year 2020 CECL transition, but is not
reporting any adjustments for the current quarter because
it does not have a positive Modiﬁed CECL Transitional
Amount in the current quarter, should still report “2” for
this item.
Each holding company would complete Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 2(a) beginning in the FR Y-9C report for its
ﬁrst reporting period under CECL and in each subsequent
FR Y-9C report thereafter until Schedule HC-R, Part I,
item 2(a) is removed from the report. Effective Decem-
ber 31, 2026, the Board proposes to remove item 2(a)
from Schedule HC-R, Part I, because the optional 3-year
and 5-year 2020 transition periods will have ended for all
electing holding companies. If an individual electing
holding company’s 3-year or 5-year transition period
ends before Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 2(a) is removed
(e.g., its transitiom period ends December 31, 2022), the
holding company would report in item 2(a) that its CECL
transition election is no longer in effect.
Line Item 3
Accumulated other comprehensive
income (AOCI).
Report the amount of AOCI as reported under U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that is
included in Schedule HC, item 26.b.
Line Item 3(a)
AOCI opt-out election.
(i) All holding companies, except advanced approaches
holding companies:
A holding company that is not an advanced approaches
holding company may make a one-time election to
become subject to the AOCI-related adjustments in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, items 9(a) through 9(e). That is,
such a holding company may opt-out of the requirement
to include most components of AOCI in common equity
tier 1 capital (with the exception of accumulated net
gains and losses on cash ﬂow hedges related to items that
are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet). A
holding company that makes an AOCI opt-out election
must enter “1” for “Yes” in Schedule HC-R, Part I,
item 3(a).
A holding company (except an advanced approaches
holding company) in existence as of March 31, 2015,
made its AOCI opt-out election on the holding com-
pany’s March 31, 2015, FR Y-9C. For a holding com-
pany that comes into existence after March 31, 2015, or
becomes a non-advanced approaches holding company,
the holding company must make its AOCI opt-out elec-
tion on the holding company’s ﬁrst FR Y-9C report.
After a holding company initially makes its AOCI opt-
out election, the holding company must report its election
in each quarterly FRY-9C report thereafter. Each of the
holding company’s depository institution subsidiaries, if
any, must elect the same option as the holding company.
With prior notice to the Board, a holding company
resulting from a merger, acquisition, or purchase transac-
tion may make a new AOCI opt-out election, as described
in section 22(b)(2) of the revised regulatory capital rules.
(ii) Holding companies that do not make an AOCI
opt-out election and all advanced approaches holding
companies:
A holding company that does not make an AOCI opt-out
election and enters “0” for “No” in Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 3(a) and all advanced approaches holding
companies are subject to the AOCI-related adjustment
under Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 9(f).
7. A holding company that did not make a 5-year 2020 CECL transition
provision election because it did not record a reduction in retained earnings
due to the adoption of CECL as of the beginning of the ﬁscal year in which
the holding company adopted CECL may use the 5-year 2020 CECL
transition provision if it has a positive modiﬁed CECL transitional amount
during any quarter ending in 2020 and makes the election in the FR Y-9C
report ﬁled for the same quarter.

common equity tier 1 minority interest if: (a) the subsid-
iary is a depository institution or a foreign bank; and
(b) the capital instruments issued by the subsidiary meet
all of the criteria for common equity tier 1 capital
(qualifying common equity tier 1 capital instruments).
(i) All holding companies, except advanced approaches
holding companies
In order to complete this item 4, holding companies need
to complete Lines 6 to 10 of HC-R, Part I. Non-advanced
approaches holding companies are able to include com-
mon equity tier 1 minority interest up to 10 percent of the
parent holding company’s common equity tier 1 capital.
The 10 percent limitation is measured before the inclu-
sion of any minority interest and after the deductions
from and adjustments to the regulatory capital of the
parent holding company described in sections 22(a)
and (b) of the regulatory capital rules.
Example and a worksheet calculation: Calculate com-
mon equity tier 1 minority interest includable at the
reporting holding company’s level as follows:
Assumptions:
• The parent holding company’s common equity tier 1
capital is $100 and has two subsidiaries (subsidiary A
and subsidiary B) and has $10 of common equity tier 1
capital adjustments and deductions;
• Subsidiary A has $7 of common equity tier 1 minority
interest (that is, owned by minority shareholders).
• Subsidiary B has $5 of common equity tier 1 minority
interest (that is, owned by minority shareholders).
(ii) Advanced approaches holding companies:
In general, the minority interest limitation applies only if
a subsidiary has a surplus common equity tier 1 capital
(that is, in excess of the subsidiary’s minimum capital
requirements and the applicable capital conservation
buffer).
The following example and a worksheet is intended to
assist holding companies in determining the amount of
common equity tier 1 minority interest includable in
common equity tier 1 capital.
Example: For each consolidated subsidiary that is a
depository institution or a foreign bank, calculate com-
mon equity tier 1 minority interest includable at the
holding company level as follows:

(3)
Subtract the amount in step (2) from the amount in step (1). This is the base to
calculate the 10 percent limitation.
$100 - $10
= $90
(4)
Multiply step (3) by 10 percent. This is the maximum includable common
equity tier 1 minority interest from all subsidiaries.
$90 x 10%
= $9

Determine the lower of (4) and the total common equity tier 1 minority interest
from all subsidiaries. This is the “common equity tier 1 minority interest
includable at the reporting holding company’s level” to be included in Sched-

Assumptions:
• For this example, assume that risk-weighted assets of
the consolidated subsidiary are the same as the risk-
weighted assets of the holding company that relate to
the subsidiary ($1,000);
• The subsidiary’s common equity tier 1 capital is $80;
• The subsidiary’s common equity tier 1 minority inter-
est (that is, owned by minority shareholders) is $24.

(2)
Using the standardized approach, determine the risk-weighted assets of the holding company
that relate to the subsidiary. Note that the amount in this step (2) may differ from the amount
in step (1) due to intercompany transactions and eliminations in consolidation.
$1,000
(3)
Determine the lower of (1) or (2), and multiply that amount by 7.0 percent.8
$1,000 x 7% =
$70
(4)
Determine the dollar amount of the subsidiary’s common equity tier 1 capital (assumed $80
in this example). If this amount is less than step (3), include common equity tier 1 minority
interest (assumed to be $24 in this example) in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 4. Otherwise,
continue to step (5).
$80
(5)
Subtract the amount in step (3) from the amount in step (4). This is the “surplus
common equity tier 1 capital of the subsidiary.”
$80 - $70 = $10
(6)
Determine the percent of the subsidiary’s common equity tier 1 capital owned by third par-
ties (the minority shareholders).
$24/$80 = 30%
(7)
Multiply the percentage in step (6) by the dollar amount in step (5). This is the “surplus com-
mon equity tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary,” Subject to the transition
provisions below.
30% x $10 = $3
(8)
Subtract the amount in step (7) from the subsidiary’s common equity tier 1 minority interest.
$24 - $3 = $21

Common equity tier 1 capital:
adjustments and deductions
Note 1: As described in section 22(b) of the revised
regulatory capital rules, regulatory adjustments to com-
mon equity tier 1 capital must be made net of associated
deferred tax effects.
Note 2: As described in section 22(e) of the revised
regulatory capital rules, netting of deferred tax liabilities
(DTLs) against assets that are subject to deduction is
permitted if the following conditions are met:
(i) The DTL is associated with the asset;
8. The percentage multiplier in step (3) is the capital ratio necessary for the depository institution to avoid restrictions on distributions and discretionary
bonus payments. Advanced approaches holding companies must adjust this percentage to account for all the applicable capital buffers.

(ii) The DTL would be extinguished if the associated
asset becomes impaired or is derecognized under
GAAP; and
(iii) A DTL can only be netted against a single asset.
The amount of deferred tax assets (DTAs) that arise from
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of any
related valuation allowances, and of DTAs arising from
temporary differences that could not be realized through
net operating loss carrybacks, net of any related valuation
allowances, may be offset by DTLs (that have not been
netted against assets subject to deduction) if the follow-
ing conditions are met:
(i) Only the DTAs and DTLs that relate to taxes levied
by the same taxation authority and that are eligible for
offsetting by that authority may be offset for purposes
of this deduction.
(ii) The amount of DTLs that the holding company nets
against DTAs that arise from net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards, net of any related valuation
allowances, and against DTAs arising from tempo-
rary differences that could not be realized through
net operating loss carrybacks, net of any related
valuation allowances, must be allocated in propor-
tion to the amount of DTAs that arise from net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of
any related valuation allowances, but before any
offsetting of DTLs) and of DTAs arising from tem-
porary differences that could not be realized through
net operating loss carrybacks (net of any related
valuation allowances, but before any offsetting of
DTLs), respectively.
A holding company may offset DTLs embedded in the
carrying value of a leveraged lease portfolio acquired in a
business combination (whether accounted for under ASC
Topic 840, Leases, for those leases grandfathered upon
the adoption of ASC Topic 842 or accounted for under
ASC Topic 842, Leases, as applicable) that are not
recognized under GAAP against DTAs that are subject to
section 22(a) of the regulatory capital rules in accordance
with section 22(e).
A holding company must net DTLs against assets subject
to deduction in a consistent manner from reporting period
to reporting period. A holding company may change its
DTL netting preference only after obtaining the prior
written approval of the Board.
In addition, note that even though certain deductions may
be net of associated DTLs, the risk-weighted portion of
those items may not be reduced by the associated DTLs.
Line Item 6
LESS: Goodwill net of associated
deferred tax liabilities (DTLs).
Report the amount of goodwill included in Schedule
HC-M, item 12(b).
However, if the holding company has a DTL that is
speciﬁcally related to goodwill that it chooses to net
against the goodwill, the amount of disallowed goodwill
to be reported in this item should be reduced by the
amount of the associated DTL.
If an advanced approaches holding company has signiﬁ-
cant investments in the capital of unconsolidated ﬁnan-
cial institutions in the form of common stock, the holding
company should report in this item goodwill embedded
in the valuation of a signiﬁcant investment in the capital
of an unconsolidated ﬁnancial institution in the form of
common stock (embedded goodwill). Such deduction of
embedded goodwill would apply to investments accounted
for under the equity method. Under GAAP, if there is a
difference between the initial cost basis of the investment
and the amount of underlying equity in the net assets of
the investee, the resulting difference should be accounted
for as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary
(which may include imputed goodwill).
Line Item 7
LESS: Intangible assets (other than
goodwill and mortgage servicing assets (MSAs)), net
of associated DTLs.
Report all intangible assets (other than goodwill and
MSAs), included in Schedule HC-M, item 12(c), that do
not qualify for inclusion in common equity tier 1 capital
under the regulatory capital rules. Generally, all pur-
chased credit card relationships (PCCRs), non-mortgage
servicing assets, and all other intangibles, reported in
Schedule HC-M, item 12(c), do not qualify for inclusion
in common equity tier 1 capital and should be included in
this item.
However, if the holding company has a DTL that is
speciﬁcally related to an intangible asset (other than
goodwill and MSAs) that it chooses to net against the
intangible asset for regulatory capital purposes, the
amount of disallowed intangibles to be reported in this
item should be reduced by the amount of the associated
DTL. Furthermore, a DTL that the holding company

chooses to net against the related intangible reported that
arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryfor-

valuation allowances, for regulatory capital purposes.
If the amount reported for other identiﬁable intangible
assets in Schedule HC-M, item 12(c), includes intangible

below.
(1) After-tax gain-on-sale in connection with a securi-
tization exposure.
Include any after-tax gain-on-sale in connection with a
securitization exposure. Gain-on-sale means an increase
in the equity capital of a holding company resulting from
a securitization (other than an increase in equity capital
resulting from the holding company’s receipt of cash in
connection with the securitization or reporting of a
mortgage servicing asset on Schedule HC).
(2) Deﬁned beneﬁt pension fund assets, net of associ-
ated DTLs.
A holding company should include for deduction in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 10(b) any deﬁned beneﬁt
pension fund assets, net of any associated DTLs. With
the prior approval of the Board, this deduction is not
required for any deﬁned beneﬁt pension fund net asset to
the extent the holdingcompany has unrestricted and
unfettered access to the assets in that fund. For an insured
depository institution, no deduction is required.
A holding company must risk weight any portion of the
deﬁned beneﬁt pension fund asset that is not deducted as
if the holding company directly holds a proportional
ownership share of each exposure in the deﬁned beneﬁt
pension fund.
(3) Investments in the holding company’s own shares
to the extent not excluded as part of treasury stock.
Include the holding company’s investments in (including
any contractual obligation to purchase) its own common
stock instruments, including direct, indirect, and syn-
thetic exposures to such capital instruments (as deﬁned in
the revised regulatory capital rules), to the extent such
capital instruments are not excluded as part of treasury
stock, reported in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 1.
If a holding company already deducts its investment in its
own shares (for example, treasury stock) from its com-
mon equity tier 1 capital elements, it does not need to
make such deduction twice.
A holding company may deduct gross long positions net
of short positions in the same underlying instrument only
if the short positions involve no counterparty credit risk
and all other criteria in section 22(h) of the revised
regulatory capital rules are met.
The holding company must look through any holdings of
index securities to deduct investments in its own capital
instruments.
In addition:
(i)
Gross long positions in investments in a holding
company’s own regulatory capital instruments
resulting from holdings of index securities may be
netted against short positions in the same under-
lying index;

(ii)
Short positions in index securities to hedge long
cash or synthetic positions may be decomposed to
recognize the hedge; and
(iii)
The portion of the index composed of the same
underlying exposure that is being hedged may be
used to offset the long position only if both the
exposure being hedged and the short position in
the index are covered positions under the market
risk rule, and the hedge is deemed effective by the
holding company’s internal control processes
which would have been assessed by the Board.
(4) Reciprocal cross-holdings in the capital of ﬁnan-
cial institutions in the form of common stock.
Include investments in the capital of other ﬁnancial
institutions (in the form of common stock) that the
holding company holds reciprocally (this is the corre-
sponding deduction approach). Such reciprocal crossh-
oldings may result from a formal or informal arrange-
ment to swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each
other’s capital instruments.
(5) Advanced approaches holding companies only
that exit parallel run.9
Include the amount of expected credit loss that exceeds
the holding company’s eligible credit reserves.
An advanced approaches holding company that has
exited parallel run and has elected to apply the 3-year
CECL transition provision (3-year CECL electing
advanced approaches holding company) should decrease
its eligible credit reserves by the applicable eligible credit
reserves transitional amount in accordance with sec-
tion 301 of the regulatory capital rules. Speciﬁcally, a
3-year CECL electing advanced approaches holding com-
pany should reduce the amount of its eligible credit
reserves by 75 percent of its eligible credit reserves
transitional amount during the ﬁrst year of the transition
period, 50 percent of its eligible credit reserves transi-
tional amount during the second year of the transition

An advanced approaches holding company that has
exited parallel run and has elected to apply the 5-year
2020 CECL transition provision (5-year CECL electing

the holding company can elect which investments it
must deduct and which it must risk weight. Depend-
ing on the holding company’s election and the com-
ponent of capital for which the underlying instrument
would qualify will determine if it will be deducted
and reported in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 13.a or
be deducted and reported in Schedule HC-R, Part I,
item 24 or 43.
(3) If the amount in (1) is less than 25 percent of
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 12 (Column A), report
zero in this item 13.a.
If the holding company included embedded goodwill in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 6, to avoid double counting,
the holding company may net such embedded goodwill
already deducted against the exposure amount of the
investment. For example, if a holding company has
deducted $10 of goodwill embedded in a $100 invest-
ment in the capital of an unconsolidated ﬁnancial institu-
tion, the holding company would be allowed to net such
embedded goodwill against the exposure amount of such
investment (that is, the value of the investment would be
$90 for purposes of the calculation of the amount that
would be subject to deduction).
Example and a worksheet calculation:
Assumptions:
For this example, assume that a holding company:
• has $20 of total investments in the capital of unconsoli-
dated ﬁnancial institutions,
• of that $20, $9 are investments in common equity tier 1
capital instruments, $7 are investments in tier 1 capital
instruments, and $4 are investments in tier 2 capital
instruments,
• has total common equity tier 1 capital subtotal (reported
on Part I, line item 12 (Column A) of $60
• has total additional tier 1 capital of $20
• has total tier 2 capital of $3
Since the community bank leverage ratio framework
does not have a total capital requirement, a CBLR
electing holding company is neither required to calculate
tier 2 capital nor make any deductions that would have
been taken from tier 2 capital under the generally appli-
cable rule. Therefore, if a CBLR electing holding com-
pany has investments in the capital instruments of an
unconsolidated ﬁnancial institution that would qualify as
tier 2 capital of the CBLR electing holding company
under the generally applicable rule (tier 2 qualifying

ments in the capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institu-
tions exceed the threshold for deduction, the holding
company is not required to deduct the tier 2 qualifying
investments.
Example for a CBLR electing holding company and a
worksheet calculation:
Assumptions:
For example, assume that a holding company:
• has $20 of total investments in the capital of unconsoli-
dated ﬁnancial institutions,
• of that $20, $15 are investments in tier 1 capital
instruments, and $5 are investments in tier 2 capital
instruments,

(4)
The amount of investments deducted from regulatory
capital can be deducted from the corresponding total
amounts of regulatory capital held by the holding
company that meet each type of capital, as a holding
company chooses.
Total of $5 must be deducted from regulatory capital.
Of that, $3 will be deducted from the holding com-
pany’s $3 of tier 2 capital, and $2 will be deducted
from the holding company’s $20 of additional tier 1
capital. No deduction from common equity tier 1 will
be reported in item 13.a.

The amount of investments deducted from regulatory

Total of $5 must be deducted from regulatory capital.
Since holding companies have the ﬂexibility to choose
which items are deducted, they can elect to allocate the
tier 1 investments ﬁrst. As a result, the remaining
investment that exceeds the threshold would be tier 2
instruments. Therefore, since CBLR electing holding
companies are not required to make tier 2 deductions,
no deduction is necessary.

ﬁnancial institution in the form of common stock, the
holding company would be allowed to net such embed-

Depository institution holding companies with total con-
solidated assets of $15 billion or more as of Decem-
ber 31, 2009, that are not 2010 MHCs must phase out
non-qualifying capital instruments (that is, debt or equity
instruments that do not meet the criteria for additional
tier 1 or tier 2 capital instruments in section 20 of the
revised regulatory capital rules, but that were issued and
included in tier 1 or tier 2 capital, respectively, prior to
May 19, 2010) as set forth in Table 3, starting on
January 1, 2014, for an advanced approaches holding
company that is not an SLHC and starting January 1,
2015, for a non-advanced approaches holding company.
If non-advanced approaches holding companies have
non-qualifying capital instruments that are excluded from
tier 1 capital, such non-qualifying capital instruments can
be included in tier 2 capital, without limitation, provided
the instruments meet the criteria for tier 2 capital set forth
in section 20(d) of the revised regulatory capital rules.
For the case of advanced approaches holding companies,
non-qualifying capital instruments that are phased out of
tier 1 capital under Table 3 are fully includable in tier 2
capital until December 31, 2015. From January 1, 2016,
until December 31, 2021, these holding companies are
required to phase out such non-qualifying capital instru-
ments from tier 2 capital in accordance with the percent-
age in Table 3, in line item 38.
Transition provisions for non-qualifying capital instru-
ments includable in additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital:
Table 3 applies separately to additional tier 1 and tier 2
non-qualifying capital instruments. For example, an
advanced approaches holding company may include up
to 50 percent of non-qualifying capital instruments in
additional tier 1 capital during calendar year 2014 but it
cannot include any such instruments in additional tier 1
capital starting in calendar year 2016.
If the holding company is involved in a merger or
acquisition, it should treat its non-qualifying capital
instruments following the requirements in section 300 of
the Board’s revised regulatory capital rules.

Tier 1 minority interest not included
in common equity tier 1 capital.
Report the amount of tier 1 minority interest not included
in common equity tier 1 capital that is includable at the
consolidated level, calculated as described below in
section 21 of the regulatory capital rules.
(i) All holding companies, except advanced approaches
holding companies
Non-advanced approaches holding companies are able to
include tier 1 minority interest up to 10 percent of the
parent holding company’s tier 1 capital. The 10 percent
limitation is measured before the inclusion of any minor-
ity interest and after the deductions from and adjustments
to the regulatory capital of the parent holding company
described in sections 22(a) and (b) of the capital rule.
Tier 1 minority interest is the portion of tier 1 capital in a
reporting holding company’s subsidiary not attributable,
directly or indirectly, to the parent holding company.
Note that a holding company may only include tier 1
minority interest if the capital instruments issued by the
subsidiary meet all of the criteria for tier 1 capital
(qualifying tier 1 capital instruments).

• Subsidiary B has $6 of additional tier 1 minority
interest (that is, owned by minority shareholders).
• The subsidiary’s tier 1 minority interest (that is, owned
by minority shareholders) is $24 ($12 of common
equity tier 1 minority interest and $12 of minority
interest in the form of additional tier 1 instruments).
(ii) Advanced approaches holding companies
For each consolidated subsidiary, perform the calcula-
tions in steps (1) through (10) of the worksheet below.
Sum up the results from step 10 for each consolidated
subsidiary and report the aggregate number in this
item 22.
For tier 1 minority interest, there is no requirement that
the subsidiary be a depository institution or a foreign
bank. However, the instrument that gives rise to tier 1
minority interest must meet all the criteria for either
common equity tier 1 capital or additional tier 1 capital
instrument.

Subtract the amount in step (3) from the amount in step (4). This is the “surplus tier 1 capi-

Determine the percent of the subsidiary’s qualifying tier 1 capital instruments that are
owned by third parties (the minority shareholders).
$24 + 15 = $39.
Then $39/$110

Multiply the percentage from step (6) by the dollar amount in step (5). This is the “surplus
tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary.”
35.45% x $25
= $8.86
(8)
Determine the total amount of tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary. Then subtract the
surplus tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary (step 7) from this amount.
$24 + $15 = $39.
Then $39 - $8.86
= $30.14

The “tier 1 minority interest includable at the holding company level” is the amount from
step (8) (or from step (4) when there is no surplus tier 1 minority interest of the subsidiary).
$30.14
(10)
Subtract any minority interest that is included in common equity tier 1 capital (from Sched-
ule HC-R, Part I, item 4). The result is the minority interest included in additional tier 1
capital.

Note: As indicated, this example built onto the example
under the instructions for item 4, where the subsidiary
was a depository institution, and where its common
equity tier 1 minority interest was includable in common

Note that a holding company should report additional

amount of additional tier 1 capital before deductions
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 23. If a holding
company does not have a sufficient amount of additional
tier 1 capital before deductions in Schedule HC-R, Part I,
item 23 to absorb these deductions, then the holding
company must deduct the shortfall from common equity
tier 1 capital in (Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 17). For
example, if a holding company reports $0 of “Additional
tier 1 capital” before deductions in Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 23 and has $100 of additional tier 1 capital
deductions, the holding company would report $100 in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 24, and add $100 to the

and report $0 in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 25, “Addi-
tional tier 1 capital.”
(i) Non-advanced approaches holding companies
(1) Investments in own additional tier 1 capital instru-
ments.
Report the holding company’s investments in (including
any contractual obligation to purchase) its own additional
tier 1 capital instruments, whether held directly or indi-
rectly.
A holding company may deduct gross long positions net
of short positions in the same underlying instrument only
if the short positions involve no counterparty risk.
The holding company must look through any holdings of
index securities to deduct investments in its own capital
instruments. In addition:
(i) Gross long positions in investments in a holding
company’s own regulatory capital instruments
resulting from holdings of index securities may be
netted against short positions in the same index;
(ii) Short positions in index securities that are hedging
long cash or synthetic positions can be decom-
posed to recognize the hedge; and
(iii) The portion of the index that is composed of the
same underlying exposure that is being hedged
may be used to offset the long position if both the
exposure being hedged and the short position in the
index are covered positions under the market risk
capital rule, and the hedge is deemed effective by
the holding company’s internal control processes.
(2) Reciprocal cross-holdings in the capital of ﬁnan-
cial institutions.
Include investments in the additional tier 1 capital instru-
ments of other ﬁnancial institutions that the holding
company holds reciprocally, where such reciprocal cross-
holdings result from a formal or informal arrangement to
swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other’s
capital instruments. If the holding company does not
have a sufficient amount of a speciﬁc component of
capital to effect the required deduction, the shortfall must
be deducted from the next higher (that is, more subordi-
nated) component of regulatory capital.
For example, if a holding company is required to deduct a
certain amount from additional tier 1 capital and it does
not have additional tier 1 capital, then the deduction
should be from common equity tier 1 capital in Schedule
HC-R, Part I, item 17.
(3) Investments in the capital of unconsolidated ﬁnan-
cial institutions that exceed the 25 percent thresh-
old to be deducted from additional tier 1 capital.
Report the total amount of investments in the capital of
unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions in the form of addi-
tional tier 1 capital that exceed the 25 percent threshold.

ﬁnancial institutions qualiﬁes. The holding company
can elect which investments it must deduct and
which it must risk weight. Depending on the holding
company’s election and the component of capital for
which the underlying instrument would qualify will
determine if it will be deducted and reported in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 13.a or be deducted and
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 24 or 41.
(3) If the amount in (1) is less than 25 percent of
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 12 (Column A), no
deduction is needed.
See Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 13 for an example of
how to deduct amounts of investments in the capital of
unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions that exceed the 25%
threshold.
Since the community bank leverage ratio framework
does not have a total capital requirement, a CBLR
electing holding company is neither required to calculate
tier 2 capital nor make any deductions that would have
been taken from tier 2 capital under the generally appli-
cable rule. Therefore, if a CBLR electing holding com-
pany has investments in the capital instruments of an
unconsolidated ﬁnancial institution that would qualify as
tier 2 capital of the electing holding company under the
generally applicable rule (tier 2 qualifying investments),
and the holding company’s total investments in the
capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions exceed the
threshold for deduction, the holding company is not
required to deduct the tier 2 qualifying investments.
(4) Other adjustments and deductions.
Include adjustments and deductions applied to additional
tier 1 capital due to insufficient tier 2 capital to cover
deductions (related to reciprocal cross-holdings, non-
signiﬁcant investments in the tier 2 capital of unconsoli-
dated ﬁnancial institutions, and signiﬁcant investments in
the tier 2 capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions).
Eligible holding companies that opt into the community
bank leverage ratio framework, are not required to calcu-
late tier 2 capital and would not be required to make any
deductions that would be taken from tier 2 capital.
(ii) Advanced approaches holding companies
(1) Investments in own additional tier 1 capital instru-
ments:
Report the holding company’s investments in (including
any contractual obligation to purchase) its own additional
tier 1 capital instruments, whether held directly or indi-
rectly.
A holding company may deduct gross long positions net
of short positions in the same underlying instrument only
if the short positions involve no counterparty risk.
The holding company must look through any holdings of
index securities to deduct investments in its own capital
instruments. In addition:
(i)
Gross long positions in investments in a holding
company’s own regulatory capital instrumentsre-

may be used to offset the long position if both the
exposure being hedged and the short position in
the index are covered positions under the market
risk capital rule, and the hedge is deemed effec-
tive by the holding company’s internal control
processes.
(2) Reciprocal cross-holdings in the capital of ﬁnan-
cial institutions.
Include investments in the additional tier 1 capital instru-
ments of other ﬁnancial institutions that the holding
company holds reciprocally, where such reciprocal cross-
holdings result from a formal or informal arrangement to
swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other’s
capital instruments. If the holding company does not
have a sufficient amount of a speciﬁc component of
capital to effect the required deduction, the shortfall must
be deducted from the next higher (that is, more subordi-
nated) component of regulatory capital.
For example, if a holding company is required to deduct a
certain amount from additional tier 1 capital and it does
not have additional tier 1 capital, then the deduction
should be from common equity tier 1 capital in Schedule
HC-R, Part I, item 17.

that exceed the 10 percent threshold for non-
signiﬁcant investments.
Schedule HC-R
FR Y-9C
HC-R-31
Schedule HC-R
March 2020

As noted in the instructions for HC-R, Part 1, item 11
above, a holding company has a non-signiﬁcant invest-
ment in the capital of an unconsolidated ﬁnancial institu-
tion if it owns 10 percent or less of the issued and
outstanding common shares of that institution.
Calculate this amount as follows:
(1) Determine the aggregate amount of non-signiﬁcant
investments in the capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial
institutions in the form of common stock, additional
tier 1 capital, tier 2 capital, and covered debt instru-
ments.14
(2) Determine the amount of non-signiﬁcant investments
in the capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions
in the form of additional tier 1 capital.
(3) If the amount in (1) is greater than the 10 percent
threshold for non-signiﬁcant investments (Schedules
HC-R, Part 1, item 11, step (4)), then multiply the
difference by the ratio of (2) over (1). Report this
product in this item 24.
(4) If the amount in (1) is less than the 10 percent
threshold for non-signiﬁcant investments, report zero.
For example, assume a holding company has a total of
$200 in non-signiﬁcant investments (step 1), including
$60 in the form of additional tier 1 capital (step 2), and its
10 percent threshold for non-signiﬁcant investments is
$100 (as calculated in step 4 of item 11). Since the
aggregate amount of non-signiﬁcant investments exceeds
the 10 percent threshold for non-signiﬁcant investments
by $100 ($200-$100), the holding company must multi-
ply $100 by the ratio of 60/200 (step 3). Thus, the
holding company would need to deduct $30 from its
additional tier 1 capital.
(4) Signiﬁcant investments in the capital of unconsoli-
dated ﬁnancial institutions not in the form of
common stock to be deducted from additional
tier 1 capital.
Report the total amount of signiﬁcant investments in the
capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions in the
form of additional tier 1 capital.
(5) Other adjustments and deductions.
Include adjustments and deductions applied to additional
tier 1 capital due to insufficient tier 2 capital to cover
deductions (related to reciprocal cross holdings, non-
signiﬁcant investments in the tier 2 capital of unconsoli-
dated ﬁnancial institutions, signiﬁcant investments in the
tier 2 capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions,
signiﬁcant investments in the covered debt instruments of
unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions, non-signiﬁcant
investments in the covered debt instruments of unconsoli-
dated ﬁnancial institutions, and investments in nonquali-
fying excluded covered debt instruments).
Also include adjustments and deductions related to DTAs
that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryfor-
wards, gain-on-sale in connection with a securitization
exposure, deﬁned beneﬁt pension fund assets, and changes
in fair value of liabilities due to changes in own credit

due to insufficient amounts of additional tier 1 capital,
and which is included in the amount reported in Schedule
HC-R, Part I, item 24. (This is to avoid double counting.)
Line Item 29
LESS: Other deductions from
(additions to) assets for leverage ratio purposes.
Based on the Board’s capital rules, report the amount of
any deductions from (additions to) total assets for lever-
age capital purposes that are not included in Schedule
HC-R, Part I, item 28, as well as the items below, if
applicable. If the amount is a net deduction, report it as a
positive value in this item. If the amount is a net addition,
report it as a negative value in this item.
Include as a deduction the quarterly average amount of
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans pledged to the
PPP Liquidity Facility (PPPLF). This quarterly average
should be consistent with and calculated using the same
averaging method used for calculating the quarterly
average for “Total consolidated assets” reported in
Schedule HC-K, item 5. Holding companies also should
report in Schedule HC-M, item 25.e, the quarterly aver-
age amount of PPP loans pledged to the PPPLF that are
included as a deduction in this item 29.
Include as a deduction the quarterly average amount of
assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund
Liquidity Facility (MMLF). This quarterly average should
be consistent with and calculated using the same averag-
ing method used for calculating the quarterly average for
“Total consolidated assets” reported in Schedule HC-K,

Holding companies that make the AOCI opt-out election
in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3.a – Deﬁned beneﬁt
postretirement plans:
If the reporting holding company sponsors a single-
employer deﬁned beneﬁt postretirement plan, such as a
pension plan or health care plan, accounted for in accor-
dance with ASC Subtopic 715-20, Compensation-
Retirement Beneﬁts—Deﬁned Beneﬁt Plans-General (for-
merly FASB Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
for Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans”), the holding company should adjust total assets
for leverage ratio purposes for any amounts included in
Schedule HC, item 26.b, “Accumulated other compre-
hensive income” (AOCI), affecting assets as a result of
the initial and subsequent application of the funded status
and measurement date provisions of ASC Subtopic 715-
20. The adjustment also should take into account subse-
quent amortization of these amounts from AOCI into
earnings. The intent of the adjustment reported in this
item (together with the amount reported in Schedule
HC-R, Part I, item 9.d) is to reverse the effects on AOCI
of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 for regulatory capital
purposes. Speciﬁcally, assets recognized or derecognized
as an adjustment to AOCI as part of the incremental
effect of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20 should be
Schedule HC-R

reported as an adjustment to total assets for leverage ratio
purposes. For example, the derecognition of an asset
recorded as an offset to AOCI as part of the initial
incremental effect of applying ASC Subtopic 715-20
should be added back to total assets for leverage ratio
purposes by reporting the amount as a negative number
in this item. As another example, the portion of a beneﬁt
plan surplus asset that is included in Schedule HC,
item 26.b, as an increase to AOCI and in total assets
should be deducted from total assets for leverage ratio
purposes by reporting the amount as a positive number in
this item.
Holding companies that do not make the AOCI opt-out
election and all advanced approaches holding compa-
nies – Available-for-sale debt securities:
Available-for-sale debt securities are reﬂected at amor-
tized cost when calculating average total consolidated
assets for Schedule HC-K, item 5. Therefore, include in
this item as a deduction from (addition to) assets for
leverage ratio purposes the amount needed to adjust the
quarterly average for available-for-sale debt securities
included in Schedule HC-K, item 5, from an average
based on amortized cost to an average based on fair
value. If the deferred tax effects of any net unrealized
gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities were
excluded from the determination of average total consoli-
dated assets for Schedule HC-K, item 5, also include in
this item as a deduction from (addition to) assets for
leverage ratio purposes the quarterly average amount
necessary to reverse the effect of this exclusion on the
quarterly average amount of net deferred tax assets
included in Schedule HC-K, item 5.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk
(SA-CCR) for purposes of the standardized approach
and supplementary leverage ratio (as applicable). Other
non-advanced approaches holding companies that did
not elect to use SA-CCR, and all advanced approaches
holding companies should leave this item blank.
Item 31.b
Standardized Approach for
Counterparty Credit Risk opt-in election:
A non-advanced approaches holding company may con-
tinue to use CEM or elect to use Standardized Approach
for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) for purposes of
the standardized approach and supplementary leverage
ratio (as applicable). Where a holding company has the
option to choose among the approaches applicable to
such a holding company under the capital rule, it must
use the same approach for all purposes. For advanced
approaches holding company, adoption of the SA-CCR
methodology is mandatory beginning January 1, 2022.
The SA-CCR rule provides non-advanced approaches
holding companies the option to adopt SA-CCR for
purposes of standardized total risk-weighted assets and,
if applicable, the supplementary leverage ratio.
Non-advanced approaches holding company that adopt
SA-CCR must notify the Board as prescribed below:
A non-advanced approaches holding company that adopts
SA-CCR must notify the Board that it made a SA-CCR
opt-in election by entering “1” for “Yes” in this memo-
randa item 31.b. A non-advanced approaches holding
company that does not make a SA-CCR opt-in election
may leave memoranda item 31.b blank. A non-advanced
approaches holding company must use the same method-
ology to calculate the exposure amount for all its deriva-
tive contracts and, if a holding company has elected to
use SA-CCR, a holding company may change its election
only with prior approval of its appropriate federal super-
visor.

In the case of consumer home equity or mortgage lines of
credit secured by liens on 1-4 family residential proper-
ties, a holding company is deemed able to uncondition-
ally cancel the commitment if, at its option, it can
prohibit additional extensions of credit, reduce the credit
line, and terminate the commitment to the full extent
permitted by relevant federal law.

(8)
Determine the total amount of total capital minority interest of the subsidiary. Then subtract
the surplus total capital minority interest of the subsidiary (step 7) from this amount.
$24 + $15 + $15
= $54. Then $54 -
$10.39 = $43.62.

Subtract from (9) any minority interest that is included in common equity tier 1 and addi-
tional tier 1 capital. The result is the total capital minority interest not included in tier 1
capital includable in total capital.

the holding company’s allocated transfer risk reserve, if
any, is includable in tier 2 capital.
A holding company’s AACL for regulatory capital pur-

A holding company that has elected to apply the 3-year
CECL transition provision (3-year CECL electing hold-
ing company) should decrease its AACL by the applica-
ble AACL transitional amount, in accordance with sec-

transition period, ﬁfty percent of its AACL transitional
amount during the second year of the transition period,
and twenty-ﬁve percent of its AACL transitional amount
during the third year of the transition period (see Table 2
in the General Instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part I).
A holding company that has elected to apply the 5-year
2020 CECL transition provision (5-year CECL electing
holding company) should decrease its AACL by the
applicable modiﬁed AACL transitional amount in accor-
dance with section 301 of the regulatory capital rules.
Speciﬁcally, a 5-year CECL electing holding company
should reduce the amount of its AACL by 100 percent of
its modiﬁed AACL transitional amount during the ﬁrst
and second years of the transition period, 75 percent of its
modiﬁed AACL transitional amount during the third year
of the transition period, 50 percent of its modiﬁed AACL
transitional amount during the fourth year of the transi-
tion period, and 25 percent of its modiﬁed AACL transi-
tional amount during the ﬁfth year of the transition period
(see Example of Application of the 5-Year 2020 CECL
Transition Provision for Third Quarter 2020 in the Gen-
eral Instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part I).
The amount to be reported in this item is (1) the holding
company’s AACL, for regulatory capital purposes, as
deﬁned above, or (2) 1.25 percent of the holding com-
pany’s risk-weighted assets base for the AACL calcula-
tion as reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 26. In
calculating the risk-weighted assets base for this purpose,
a holding company would not include items that are
deducted from capital under section 22(a). However, a
holding company would include risk-weighted asset
amounts of items deducted from capital under sections
22(c) through (f) of the regulatory capital rule. While
amounts deducted from capital under section 22(c)
through (f) are included in the risk-weighted asset base
for the AACL calculation, such amounts are excluded
from standardized total risk-weighted assets used in the
denominator of the risk-based capital ratios.
The amount, if any, by which a holding company’s
AACL for regulatory capital purposes exceeds 1.25
percent of the holding company’s risk-weighted assets
base for the AACL calculation (as reported in Schedule
HC-R, Part II, item 26) should be reported in Schedule
HC-R, Part II, item 29, “LESS: Excess allowance for
credit losses on loans and leases.”
NOTE: Item 40.b is to be completed only by advanced
approaches holding companies that exit parallel run.
Item 40.b is not applicable to non-advanced approaches
holding companies.
Line Item 40(b)
Advanced approaches holding
companies that exit parallel run only: eligible credit
reserves includable in tier 2 capital.
Report the amount of eligible credit reserves includable
in tier 2 capital as reported in FFIEC 101 Schedule A,
item 50.
An advanced approaches holding company that has
exited parallel run and has elected to apply the 3-year
CECL transition provision (3-year CECL electing
advanced approaches holding company) should decrease
its eligible credit reserves by the applicable eligible credit
reserves transitional amount in accordance with sec-
tion 301 of the regulatory capital rules. Speciﬁcally, a
3-year CECL electing advanced approaches holding com-
pany should reduce the amount of its eligible credit
reserves by 75 percent of its eligible credit reserves
transitional amount during the ﬁrst year of the transition
period, 50 percent of its eligible credit reserves transi-
tional amount during the second year of the transition
period, and 25 percent of its eligible credit reserves
transitional amount during the third year of the transition
period.
An advanced approaches holding company that has
exited parallel run should decrease its eligible credit
reserves by the applicable eligible credit reserves transi-
tional amount in accordance with section 301 of the
regulatory capital rules. Speciﬁcally, a 5-year CECL
electing advanced approaches holding company should
reduce the amount of its eligible credit reserves by
100 percent of its eligible credit reserves transitional
amount during the ﬁrst and second years of the transition
period; 75 percent of its eligible credit reserves transi-
tional amount during the third year of the transition
period; 50 percent of its eligible credit reserves transi-
tional amount during the fourth year of the transition
period; and 25 percent of its eligible credit reserves
transitional amount during the ﬁfth year of the transition

Item 42.b is not applicable to non-advanced approaches

Line Item 42(b)—Advanced approaches holding

Report the sum of Schedule HC-R, Part 1, items 37
through 39, plus item 40(b).
Line Item 43
LESS: Tier 2 capital deductions.
Report total tier 2 capital deductions as the sum of the
following elements:
Note that a holding company should report tier 2 capital
deductions in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 43 irrespective
of the amount of tier 2 capital before deductions reported
in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 42(a). If holding company
does not have a sufficient amount of tier 2 capital before
deductions in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 42(a) to
absorb these deductions, then the holding company must
deduct the shortfall from additional tier 1 capital before
deductions in Schedule HC-R, Part 1, item 24, or, if there
is not enough additional tier 1 capital before deductions,
from common equity tier 1 capital in Schedule HC-R,
Part 1, item 17.
For example, if a holding company reports $98 of ‘‘tier 2
capital before deductions’’ in item 42(a) and must make
$110 in tier 2 capital deductions, the holding company
would report $110 in item 43, and would include the
additional $12 in deductions in Schedule HC-R, Part 1,
item 24 (and in Schedule HC-R, Part 1, item 17, in the
case of insufficient “Additional tier 1 capital before
deductions” in item 23 from which to make the deduction
in Schedule HC-R, item 24), and report $0 in item 44(a),
“Tier 2 capital.”
In addition, advanced approaches holding companies
with insufficient tier 2 capital for deductions will make
the following adjustments: an advanced approaches hold-
ing company will make deductions on this schedule
under the generally applicable rules that apply to all
holding companies. It will use FFIEC 101, Schedule A,
to calculate its capital requirements under the advanced
approaches rule. Therefore, in the case of an advanced
approaches holding company with insufficient tier 2
capital to make tier 2 deductions, it will use the corre-
sponding deduction approach and the generally applica-
ble rules to take excess tier 2 deductions from additional
tier 1 capital in Schedule HC-R, item 24, and if necessary
from common equity tier 1 capital in Schedule HC-R,
item 17. It will use the advanced approaches rules to take
deductions on the FFIEC 101 form.
For example, assume tier 2 capital is $100 under the
advanced approaches rule and $98 under the generally
applicable rules (due to the difference between the
amount of eligible credit reserves includable in tier 2
capital under the advanced approaches, and AACL, as
applicable, includable in tier 2 capital under the standard-
ized approach). If the required deduction from tier 2
capital is $110, then the advanced approaches holding
company would add $10 to the required additional tier 1
capital deductions (on FFIEC 101, Schedule A, line 42,
and FFIEC 101, Schedule A, line 27, if necessary), and
would add $12 to its required additional tier 1 capital
deductions for the calculation of the standardized approach
regulatory capital ratios in this schedule (Schedule HC-R,
item 24, and Schedule HC-R, item 17, if necessary).
(i) Non-advanced approaches holding companies
(1) Investments in own tier 2 capital instruments.
Report the holding company’s investments in (including
any contractual obligation to purchase) its own tier 2
instruments, whether held directly or indirectly.
A holding company may deduct gross long positions net
of short positions in the same underlying instrument only
if the short positions involve no counterparty risk.
The holding company must look through any holdings of
index securities to deduct investments in its own capital
instruments. In addition:
(i)
Gross long positions in investments in a holding
company’s own regulatory capital instruments
resulting from holdings of index securities may be
netted against short positions in the same index;
(ii) Short positions in index securities that are hedg-
ing long cash or synthetic positions can be decom-
posed to recognize the hedge; and
(iii) The portion of the index that is composed of the
same underlying exposure that is being hedged
may be used to offset the long position if both the

processes.
(2) Reciprocal cross-holdings in the capital of ﬁnan-
cial institutions.
Include investments in the tier 2 capital instruments of
other ﬁnancial institutions that the holding company
holds reciprocally, where such reciprocal crossholdings
result from a formal or informal arrangement to swap,
exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other’s capital
instruments.
(3) Investments in the capital of unconsolidated ﬁnan-
cial institutions that exceed the 25 percent thresh-
old to be deducted from tier 2.
Report the total amount of investments in the capital of
unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions in the form of tier 2
capital that exceed the 25 percent threshold.
Calculate the amount as follows:
(1) Determine the amount of investments in the capital
of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions, net of associ-
ated DTLs.
(2) If the amount in (1) is greater than 25 percent of
Schedule HC-R, Part 1, item 12 (Column A), report
the difference across Schedule HC-R, Part I,
items 13.a, 24 or 43, depending on the tier of capital
the investments in the capital of unconsolidated
ﬁnancial institutions qualiﬁes. The holding company
can elect which investments it must deduct and
which it must risk weight. Depending on the holding
company’s election and the component of capital for
which the underlying instrument would qualify will
determine if it will be deducted and reported in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 13.a or be deducted and
reported in Schedule HCR, Part I, item 24 or 43.
(3) If the amount in (1) is less than 25 percent of
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 12 (Column A), no
deduction is needed.
See Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 13.a for an example of
how to deduct amounts of investments in the capital of
unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions that exceed the
25 percent threshold.
(4) Other adjustments and deductions.
Include any other applicable adjustments and deductions
applied to tier 2 capital in accordance with the regulatory
capital rules of the Board.

tion to purchase) its own covered debt instruments, as
applicable, whether held directly or indirectly.
A holding company may deduct gross long positions net
of short positions in the same underlying instrument only
if the short positions involve no counterparty risk.
The holding company must look through any holdings of
index securities to deduct investments in its own capital
instruments. In addition:

• a direct exposure or an indirect exposure to a
covered debt instrument held in connection with
market making-related activities permitted under
12 CFR 248.4 and has been held for more than
30 business days.
Such an institution must also report its aggregate
investment in excluded covered debt instruments that
exceeds 5 percent of the institution’s common equity
tier 1 capital, calculated as follows:
(1) Determine the aggregate amount of investments
in excluded covered debt instruments measured
on a gross long basis in accordance with 12 CFR

cent of the amount of Schedule HC-R,
item 12, report the difference, on a net
long position basis in accordance with
§217.22(h)(1), in steps (2) and (3) below
as the holding company’s amount of “cov-
ered debt instruments.”
(2) Determine
the
aggregate
amount
of
non-
signiﬁcant investments in the capital of uncon-

Capital Buffer for Holding Companies
Not Subject to the Capital Plan Rule
(items 50-52)
For all holding companies: In order to avoid limitations
on distributions, including dividend payments, and cer-
tain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a
holding company must hold an institution speciﬁc capital
buffer16 above its minimum risk-based capital require-
ments.
Line Item 50
Capital conservation buffer.
Report the holding company’s capital conservation buffer
as a percentage, rounded to four decimal places. Except
as described below, the capital conservation buffer is
equal to the lowest of ratios of (1), (2), (3) below:
For example, the capital buffer to be reported in this
item 50 for the December 31, 2020, report date would be
based on the capital ratios reported in Schedule HC-R,
Part I, of the FRY9C Report for December 31, 2020.
For all holding companies, except advanced
approaches holding companies not subject to the
Capital Plan Rule, that exit parallel run:
(1) Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 47, Column A, less
4.5000, which is the minimum common equity tier 1
capital ratio requirement under section 10 of the
regulatory capital rules;
(2) Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 48, Column A, less
6.0000 percent, which is the minimum tier 1 capital
ratio requirement under section 10 of the regulatory
capital rule;
(3) Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 49, Column A, less
8.0000 percent, which is the minimum total capital
ratio requirement under section 10 of the regulatory
capital rules.
However, if any of the three ratios calculated above is
less than zero (i.e., is negative), the holding company’s
capital conservation buffer is zero.
For advanced approaches holding companies not
subject to the Capital Plan Rule that exit parallel
run only:
(1) The lower of Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 47, column
A and column B, less 4.5000 percent, which is the
minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio require-
ment under section 10 of the regulatory capital rules;
(2) The lower of Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 48, column
A and column B, less 6.0000 percent, which is the
minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement under sec-
tion 10 of the regulatory capital rules; and
(3) The lower of Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 49, col-
umn A and column B, less 8.0000 percent, which is
the minimum total capital ratio requirement under
section 10 of the regulatory capital rules.
However, if any of the three ratios calculated above is
less than zero (i.e., is negative), the holding company’s
capital conservation buffer is zero.
NOTE: Holding companies that are not subject to the
capital plan rule must complete items 51 and 52 if the
amount in item 50 is less than or equal to the required
minimum capital conservation buffer of 2.5000 per-
cent (plus any other applicable capital buffers, if the

place or if the holding company is subject to countercyclical capital buffers
in other jurisdictions. The total applicable capital buffer requirement appli-
cable to an advanced approaches holding company or Category III holding
company as of the quarter-end report date should be reported in Schedule

by issuing another capital instrument that meets the
eligibility criteria for:
(i) A common equity tier 1 capital instrument if
the instrument being repurchased was part of
the holding company’s common equity tier 1
capital, or
(ii) A common equity tier 1 or additional tier 1
capital instrument if the instrument being
repurchased was part of the holding com-
pany’s tier 1 capital;

another capital instrument that meets the eligibility
criteria for a tier 1 or tier 2 capital instrument;
(3) A dividend declaration or payment on any tier 1
capital instrument;
(4) A dividend declaration or interest payment on any
tier 2 capital instrument if the holding company has

below, the standardized approach capital conservation
buffer is equal to the lowest of the following ratios:
(1) Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 47, Column A,
less 4.5000, which is the minimum common equity
tier 1 capital ratio requirement under section 10 of
the regulatory capital rules;
(2) Schedule HC R, Part I, item 48, Column A, less
6.0000 percent, which is the minimum tier 1 capital

rounded to four decimal places. Except as described
below, the advanced approaches capital conservation
buffer is equal to the lowest of the following ratios:
(1) Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 47, Column B,
less 4.5000, which is the minimum common equity
tier 1 capital ratio requirement under section 10 of
the regulatory capital rules;
(2) Schedule HC R, Part I, item 48, Column B, less
6.0000 percent, which is the minimum tier 1 capital
ratio requirement under section 10 of the regulatory
capital rule schedule HC-R, Part I, item 49, Col-

* From a practical perspective, a holding company can
use the year-to-date net income reﬂected in Schedule HI,
item 14, for December 31, 2020, subtract from it the net
income reﬂected in Schedule HI, item 14, for March 31,
2020, and then add the net income in Schedule HI,
item 14, for March 31, 2021 to calculate the numerator in
the step 2, above. For the example above, the average of a
holding company’s three-month net income over the four
preceding calendar quarters: ($1,900 (D) less $400 (A)
plus $200 (E)) divided by 4 = $425.

of 2021, a ﬁrm would multiply its applicable maximum
payout ratio by its eligible retained income. The eligible
retained income used to calculate the maximum payout
amount for the period from April 1, 2021 to June 30,
2021 would be based on the ﬁrm’s net income for the
four calendar quarters ending on March 31, 2021 and the
maximum payout ratio would be determined based on the
capital ratios of the ﬁrm as of March 31, 2020 (as
described in item 60). Firms that are subject to stress
buffer requirements are expected to know their capital
positions on a daily basis. If a ﬁrm has any uncertainty
regarding its quarter-end capital ratios prior to ﬁling its
regulatory reports, it should be conservative with capital
distributions (including buybacks) during the beginning
of a calendar quarter in order to avoid a situation in
which it distributes more than the amount permitted
under the capital rule.
Line Item 69 Distributions and discretionary bonus
payments during the quarter.
Report the amount of distributions and discretionary
bonus payments made during the calendar quarter ending
on the report date.
For example, for purposes of the December 31, 2020,
report date, report in item 62 the distributions and
discretionary bonus payments made during the quarter
ending December 31, 2020.
See instructions for item 52 above for the deﬁnition of
“distribution.”
Part II:
Risk-Weighted Assets
Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework:
A qualifying holding company that decides to opt into the
community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework
should not complete Schedule HC-R, Part II. All other
holding companies should complete Schedule HC-R,
Part II. A qualifying holding company can opt out of the
community bank leverage ratio framework by complet-
ing Schedule HC-R, Parts I and II excluding Schedule
HC-R, Part I, items 32 through 36. Please refer to the
General Instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part I for
information on the reporting requirements that apply
when a holding company ceases to meet the applicable
leverage ratio requirement under the CBLR framework

or fails to meet any of the other CBLR qualifying criteria
and is no longer in the grace period.
General Instructions for Part II
The instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part II, items 1
through 22 provide general directions for the allocation
of holding company balance sheet assets and credit
equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet
items, and unsettled transactions to the risk weight
categories in columns C through Q (and, for items 1
through 10 only, to the items adjusted from the totals
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, column A in col-
umn B). In general, the aggregate amount allocated to
each risk-weight category is then multiplied by the risk
weight associated with that category. The resulting risk-
weighted values from each of the risk categories are
added together, and generally this sum is the Holding
company total risk-weighted assets, which comprises the
denominator of the risk-based capital ratios. These
instructions should provide sufficient guidance for most
holding companies for risk-weighting their balance sheet
assets and credit equivalent amounts. However, these
instructions do not address every type of exposure.
Holding companies should review the Board’s regulatory
capital rules for the complete description of the applica-
ble capital requirements.
Exposure Amount Subject to Risk Weighting
In general, holding companies need to risk weight the
exposure amount. The exposure amount is deﬁned in §.2
of the regulatory capital rules as follows:
(1) For the on-balance sheet component of an expo-
sure,17 the holding company’s carrying value of the
exposure.
(2) For a security18 classiﬁed as AFS or HTM where the
holding company has made the AOCI opt-out elec-
tion in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a), the carrying
value for the exposure (including net accrued but
uncollected interest and fees)19 less any net unreal-
ized gains on the exposure plus any net unrealized
loss on the exposure included in AOCI.
(3) For the off-balance sheet component of an expo-
sure,20 the notional amount of the off-balance sheet
component multiplied by the appropriate Credit con-
version factor in §.33 of the regulatory capital rules.
(4) For an exposure that is an OTC derivative contract,
the exposure amount determined under §.34 or §.132
of the regulatory capital rules.
(5) For an exposure that is a derivative contract that is a
cleared transaction, the trade exposure amount deter-
mined under §.35 or §.133 of the regulatory capital
rules.
For derivatives that have matured, but have associ-
ated unsettled receivables or payables that are reported
as assets or liabilities, respectively, on the balance
sheet as of the quarter-end report date, a holding
company does not need to report such notional
amounts for derivatives that have matured for the
purpose of Schedule HC-R, Part II, Risk-Weighted
Assets.
(6) For an exposure that is an eligible margin loan or
repo-style transaction (including a cleared transac-
tion) for which the holding company calculates the
exposure amount as provided in §.37, the exposure
amount determined under §.37 of the regulatory
capital rules.
(7) For an exposure that is a securitization exposure, the
exposure amount determined under §.42 of the regu-
latory capital rules.
As indicated in the deﬁnition in §.2 of the regulatory
capital rules, carrying value means with respect to an
17. Not including: (1) an available-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity
(HTM) security where the holding company has made the Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) opt-out election in Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 3(a), (2) an over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contract, (3) a
repo-style transaction or an eligible margin loan for which the holding
company determines the exposure amount under §.37 of the regulatory
capital rules, (4) a cleared transaction, (5) a default fund contribution, or
(6) a securitization exposure.
18. Not including: (1) a securitization exposure, (2) an equity exposure,
or (3) preferred stock classiﬁed as an equity security under generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
19. Where the holding company has made the AOCI opt-out election,
accrued but uncollected interest and fees reported in Schedule HC, item 11,
“Other assets,” associated with AFS or HTM debt securities that are not
securitization exposures should be reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II,
item 8, “All other assets.”
20. Not including: (1) an OTC derivative contract, (2) a repo-style
transaction or an eligible margin loan for which the holding company
calculates the exposure amount under §.37 of the regulatory capital rules,
(3) a cleared transaction, (4) a default fund contribution, or (5) a securitiza-
tion exposure,

asset, the value of the asset on the balance sheet of the
holding company determined in accordance with GAAP.
Amounts to Report in Column B
The amount to report in column B will vary depending
upon the nature of the particular item.
For items 1 through 8 and 11 of Schedule HC-R, Part II,
column B should include the amount of the reporting
holding company’s on-balance sheet assets that are
deducted or excluded (not risk weighted) in the determi-
nation of risk-weighted assets. Column B should include
assets that are deducted from capital such as:
• Goodwill;
• Other intangibles (other than mortgage servicing assets
(MSAs));
• Gain on sale of securitization exposures;
• For non-advanced approaches holding companies,
threshold deductions above the 25 percent individual
limits for (1) deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from
temporary differences that could not be realized through
net operating loss carrybacks, (2) MSAs, net of associ-
ated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs), and (3) invest-
ments in the capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institu-
tions;
• For advanced approaches holding companies, thresh-
old deductions above the 10 percent individual or 15
percent combined limits for (1) DTAs arising from
temporary differences that could be realized through
net operating loss carrybacks, (2) MSAs, net of associ-
ated DTLs, and (3) signiﬁcant investments in the
capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institutions in the
form of common stock;
• For advanced approaches holding companies, non-
signiﬁcant investments in the capital of unconsolidated
ﬁnancial institutions in the form of common stock that
exceed the 10 percent threshold for non-signiﬁcant
investments;
• For advanced approaches holding companies, invest-
ments in covered debt instruments and nonqualifying
excluded covered debt instruments,21 as applicable;
and
• Any other assets that must be deducted in accordance
with the requirements of the Board.
Column B should also include items that are excluded
from the calculation of risk-weighted assets, such as
allowances for credit losses; allocated transfer risk
reserves; and certain on-balance sheet asset amounts
associated with derivative contracts that are included in
the calculation of the credit equivalent amounts of the
derivative contracts. In addition, for items 1 through 8
and 11 of Schedule HC-R, Part II, column B should
include any difference between the balance sheet amount
of an on-balance sheet asset and its exposure amount as
described above under “Exposure Amount Subject to
Risk Weighting.”
Note: For items 1 through 8 and 11 of Schedule HC-R,
Part II, the sum of columns B through R must equal the
balance sheet asset amount reported in column A.
For items 9(a) through 9(d) of Schedule HC-R, Part II,
the amount a reporting holding company should report in
column B will depend upon the risk weighting approach
it uses to risk weight its securitization exposures and
whether the holding company’s has made the AOCI
opt-out election in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a). For
each of items 9(a) through 9(d), a mathematical relation-
ship similar to the one described above will hold true,
such that the sum of columns B through Q must equal the
balance sheet asset amount reported in column A.
• If the holding company uses the 1,250 percent risk
weight approach to risk weight an on-balance sheet
securitization exposure, the holding company will
report in column B the difference between the carrying
value of the exposure and the exposure amount that is
to be risk weighted. For example if a holding company
has a securitization exposure that is an AFS debt
security with a $105 carrying value (i.e., fair value)
including a $5 unrealized gain (in other words, a $100
amortized cost), the holding company would report the
following:
o If the holding company has not made (or cannot
make) the AOCI opt-out election, the holding com-
pany would report zero in item 9(b), column B. The
holding company would report the $105 exposure
amount to be risk weighted in item 9(b), column Q -
1250% risk weight.
o If the holding company has made the AOCI opt-out
election, the holding company would report any
21. Nonqualifying excluded covered debt instruments are those subject
to deduction according to the instructions for HC-R, Part I, item 43.
Schedule HC-R
HC-R-56
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-R
December 2020

unrealized gain as a positive number in item 9(b),
column B, and any unrealized loss as a negative
number in item 9(b), column B. Therefore, in this
example, the holding company would report $5 in
item 9(b), column B. Because the holding company
reverses out the unrealized gain for regulatory capi-
tal purposes because it has made the AOCI opt-out
election, it does not have to risk weight the gain.
(Note: The holding company also would report the
$100 exposure amount to be risk weighted in item
9(b), column Q - 1250% risk weight.
• If the holding company uses the Simpliﬁed Supervi-
sory Formula Approach (SSFA) or the Gross-Up
Approach to risk weight an on-balance sheet securiti-
zation exposure, the holding company will report in
column B the same amount that it reported in col-
umn A.
For item 10 of Schedule HC-R, Part II, the amount a
reporting holding company should report in column B
also will depend upon the risk weighting approach it uses
to risk weight its securitization exposures. If a holding
company uses the 1,250 percent risk weight approach to
risk weight an off-balance sheet securitization exposure,
the holding company will report in column B any differ-
ence between the notional amount of the off-balance
sheet securitization exposure that is reported in column A
and its exposure amount. If the holding company uses the
SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach to risk weight an
off-balance sheet securitization exposure, the holding
company will report in column B the same amount that it
reported in column A. An example is presented in the
instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 10. For item
10 of Schedule HC-R, Part II, the sum of columns B
through Q must equal the amount of the off-balance sheet
securitization exposures reported in column A.
For items 12 through 21 of Schedule HC-R, Part II,
column B should include the credit equivalent amounts
of the reporting holding company’s derivative contracts
and off-balance sheet items that are covered by the
regulatory capital rules. For the off-balance sheet items in
items 12 through 19, the credit equivalent amount to be
reported in column B is calculated by multiplying the
face, notional, or other amount reported in column A by
the appropriate CCF. The credit equivalent amounts in
column B are to be allocated to the appropriate risk-
weight categories in columns C through J (or to the
securitization exposure collateral category in column R,
if applicable). For items 12 through 21 of Schedule
HC-R, Part II, the sum of columns C through J (plus
column R, if applicable) must equal the credit equivalent
amount reported in column B.
Treatment of Collateral and Guarantees
a. Collateralized Transactions
The rules for recognition of collateral are in §.37 and
pertinent deﬁnitions in §.2 of the regulatory capital rules.
The regulatory capital rules deﬁne qualifying ﬁnancial
collateral as cash on deposit, gold bullion, investment
grade long- and short-term debt exposures (that are not
resecuritization exposures), publicly traded equity securi-
ties and convertible bonds, and money market fund or
other mutual fund shares with prices that are publicly
quoted on a daily basis.
Holding companies may apply one of two approaches, as
outlined in §.37, to recognize the risk-mitigating effects
of qualifying ﬁnancial collateral:
(1) Simple Approach: can be used for any type of
exposure. Under this approach, holding companies
may apply a risk weight to the portion of an exposure
that is secured by the fair value of the ﬁnancial
collateral based on the risk weight assigned to the
collateral under §.32. However, under this approach,
the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion
of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent,
unless one of the following exceptions applies:
• Zero percent risk weight - may be assigned to: an
exposure to an over the counter derivative contract
that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and
subject to a daily margin requirement, to the extent
that the contract is collateralized to cash on deposit;
to the portion of an exposure collateralized by cash
on deposit; to the portion of an exposure collateral-
ized by an exposure to a sovereign that qualiﬁes for
the zero percent risk weight under §.32 and the
holding company has discounted the fair value of
the collateral by 20 percent.
• 10 percent risk weight: may be assigned to an
exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is
marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a
daily margin requirement, to the extent that the
contract is collateralized by an exposure to a sover-
eign that qualiﬁed for a zero percent risk weight
under §.32.
Schedule HC-R
FR Y-9C
HC-R-57
Schedule HC-R
December 2015

(2) Collateral Haircut Approach: can be used only for
repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, collat-
eralized derivative transactions, and single-product
netting sets of such transactions. Under this approach,
holding companies would apply either standard super-
visory haircuts or own internal estimates for haircuts
to the value of the collateral. See §.37(c) of the
regulatory capital rules for a description of the
calculation of the exposure amount, standard super-
visory market price volatility haircuts, and require-
ments for using own internal estimates for haircuts.
Holding companies may use any approach described in
§.37 that is valid for a particular type of exposure or
transaction; however, they must use the same approach
for similar transactions or exposures.
If an exposure is partially secured, that is, the market
value (or in cases of using the Collateral Haircut
Approach, the adjusted market value) of the ﬁnancial
collateral is less than the face amount of an asset or
off-balance sheet exposure, only the portion that is
covered by the market value of the collateral is to be
reported in the risk-weight category item appropriate to
the type of collateral. The uncovered portion of the
exposure continues to be assigned to the initial risk-
weight category item appropriate to the exposure. The
face amount of an exposure secured by multiple types of
qualifying collateral is to be reported in the risk-weight
category items appropriate to the collateral types, appor-
tioned according to the market value of the types of
collateral.
Exposures collateralized by deposits at the reporting
institution
The portion of any exposure collateralized by deposits at
the reporting institution would be eligible for a zero
percent risk weight. The remaining portion of the expo-
sure that is not collateralized by deposits should be
risk-weighted according to the regulatory capital rules.
b.
Guarantees and credit derivatives
The rules for recognition of guarantees and credit deriva-
tives are in §.36 and pertinent deﬁnitions are in §.2 of the
regulatory capital rules. A holding company may recog-
nize the credit risk mitigation beneﬁts of an eligible
guarantee or eligible credit derivative by substituting the
risk weight associated with the protection provider for
the risk weight assigned to the exposure. Please refer to
the deﬁnitions of eligible guarantee, eligible guarantor,
and eligible credit derivative in §.2 of the regulatory
capital rules. Note that in the deﬁnition of eligible
guarantee, where the deﬁnition discusses contingent guar-
antees, only contingent guarantees of the U.S. govern-
ment or its agencies are recognized.
The coverage amount provided by an eligible guarantee
or eligible credit derivative will need to be adjusted
downward if:
• The residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is
less than that of the hedged exposure (maturity
mismatch adjustment), see §.36(c);
• The credit risk mitigant does not include as a
credit event a restructuring of the hedged expo-
sure involving forgiveness or postponement of
principal, interest, or fees that results in a credit
loss event (that is, a charge-off, speciﬁc provision,
or other similar debit to the proﬁt and loss
account), see §.36(d); or
• The credit risk mitigant is denominated in a
currency different from that in which the hedged
exposure is denominated (currency mismatch
adjustment), see §.36(e).
Exposures covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo-
ration (FDIC) loss sharing agreements
The portion of any exposure covered by an FDIC loss
sharing agreement would be eligible for a 20 percent risk
weight. The remaining uncovered portion of the exposure
should be risk-weighted according to the regulatory
capital rules.
Treatment of Equity Exposures
The treatment of equity exposures is outlined in §.51
through §.53 of the regulatory capital rules. Holding
companies must use different methodologies to deter-
mine risk weighted assets for their equity exposures:
• The Simple Risk Weight Approach (SRWA),
which must be used for all types of equity expo-
sures that are not equity exposures to a mutual
fund or other investment fund, and
• Full look-through, simple modiﬁed look-through,
and alternative modiﬁed look-through approaches
for equity exposures to mutual funds and other
investment funds.
Schedule HC-R
HC-R-58
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-R
December 2015

Treatment of stable value protection
The regulatory capital rules deﬁne stable value protection
(SVP) in §.51(a)(3).
A holding company that purchases SVP on an investment
in a separate account must treat the portion of the
carrying value of the investment attributable to the SVP
as an exposure to the provider of the protection. The
remaining portion of the carrying value of the investment
must be treated as an equity exposure to an investment
fund.
A holding company that provides SVP must treat the
exposure as an equity derivative with an adjusted carry-
ing value equal to the sum of the on-balance and off-
balance sheet adjusted carrying value.
Adjusted carrying value
The adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure is
equal to:
• On-balance sheet equity exposure: the carrying value
of the exposure.
• Off-balance sheet portion of an equity exposure
(that is not an equity commitment): the effective
notional principal amount22 of the exposure minus the
adjusted carrying value of the on-balance sheet compo-
nent of the exposure.
For an equity commitment (a commitment to purchase an
equity exposure), the effective notional principal amount
must be multiplied by the following CCFs: 20 percent for
conditional equity commitments with an original matu-
rity of one year or less, 50 percent for conditional equity
commitments with an original maturity of more than one
year, and 100 percent for unconditional equity commit-
ments.
Equity exposure risk weighting methodologies
(1) Simple Risk Weight Approach (SWRA): must be
used for all types of equity exposures that are not
equity exposures to a mutual fund or other invest-
ment fund. Under this approach, holding companies
must determine the risk weighted asset amount of an
individual equity exposure by multiplying (1) the
adjusted carrying value of the exposure or (2) the
effective portion and ineffective portion of a hedge
pair by the lowest possible risk weight below:
• Zero percent risk weight - an equity exposure to a
sovereign, Bank for International Settlements, the
European Central Bank, the European Commis-
sion, the International Monetary Fund, the Euro-
pean Stability Mechanism, the European Finan-
cial Stability Facility, a multilateral development
bank (MDB), and any other entity whose credit
exposures receive a zero percent risk weight under
§.32 of the regulatory capital rules.
• 20 percent risk weight: an equity exposure to a
public sector entity, Federal Home Loan Bank,
and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corpora-
tion (Farmer Mac).
• 100 percent risk weight: equity exposures to:
o Certain qualiﬁed community development
investments,
o The effective portion of hedge pairs,
o For non-advanced approaches holding compa-
nies: Equity exposures, to the extent that the
aggregate carrying value of the exposures does
not exceed 10 percent of total capital. To utilize
this risk weight, the holding company must
aggregate the following equity exposures:
unconsolidated small business investment com-
panies or held through consolidated small busi-
ness investment companies; publicly traded
(including those held indirectly through mutual
funds or other investment funds); and non-
publicly traded (including those held indirectly
through mutual funds or other investment funds),
and
o For advanced approaches holding companies:
Non-signiﬁcant equity exposures, to the extent
that the aggregate carrying value of the expo-
sures does not exceed 10 percent of total capi-
tal. To utilize this risk weight, the bank must
aggregate the following equity exposures:
unconsolidated small business investment com-
panies or held through consolidated small busi-
ness investment companies; publicly traded
22. The regulatory capital rules deﬁne the “effective notional principal
amount” as an exposure of equivalent size to a hypothetical on-balance
sheet position in the underlying equity instrument that would evidence the
same change in fair value (measured in dollars) given a small change in the
price of the underlying equity instrument.

HC-R-59
Schedule HC-R
March 2020

(including those held indirectly through mutual
funds or other investment funds); and non-
publicly traded (including those held indirectly
through mutual funds or other investment funds)
• 250 percent risk weight: For advanced approaches
holding companies only: Signiﬁcant investments
in the capital of unconsolidated ﬁnancial institu-
tions in the form of common stock that are not
deducted from capital.
• 300 percent risk weight: publicly traded equity
exposures.
• 400 percent risk weight: equity exposures that are
not publicly traded.
• 600 percent risk weight: an equity exposure to an
investment ﬁrm, provided that the investment ﬁrm
would (1) meet the deﬁnition of traditional secu-
ritization in §.2 of the regulatory capital rules
were it not for the application of paragraph (8) of
the deﬁnition and (2) has greater than immaterial
leverage.
(2) Full look-through approach: used only for equity
exposures to a mutual fund or other investment fund.
Requires a minimum risk weight of 20 percent.
Under this approach, holding companies calculate
the aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the
carrying value of the exposures held by the fund as if
they were held directly by the holding company
multiplied by the holding company’s proportional
ownership share of the fund.
(3) Simple modiﬁed look-through approach: used only
for equity exposures to a mutual fund or other
investment fund. Requires a minimum risk weight of
20 percent. Under this approach, risk-weighted assets
for an equity exposure is equal to the exposure’s
adjusted carrying value multiplied by the highest risk
weight that applies to any exposure the fund is
permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership
agreement, or similar agreement that deﬁnes the
funds permissible investments.
(4) Alternative modiﬁed look-through approach: used
only for equity exposures to a mutual fund or other
investment fund. Requires a minimum risk weight of
20 percent. Under this approach, holding companies
may assign the adjusted carrying value on a pro rata
basis to different risk weight categories based on the
limits in the fund’s prospectus, partnership agree-
ment, or similar contract that deﬁnes the fund’s
permissible investments.
Treatment of Sales of 1-4 Family Residential First
Mortgage Loans with Credit-Enhancing Representa-
tions and Warranties
When a holding company transfers mortgage loans with
credit-enhancing representations and warranties in a
transaction that qualiﬁes for sale accounting under GAAP,
the holding company will need to report and risk weight
those exposures. The deﬁnition of ‘‘credit-enhancing
representations and warranties’’ (CERWs) is found in §.2
of the regulatory capital rules. Many CERWs should be
treated as securitization exposures for purposes of risk
weighting. However, those CERWs that do not qualify as
securitization exposures receive a 100 percent CCF as
indicated in §.33 of the regulatory capital rules. For
example, if the holding company has agreed to repur-
chase the loans that it has sold, it will generally need to
risk weight those loans in Schedule HC-R, Part II,
item 17 until the warranties expire. Note that CERWs do
not include certain early default clauses and similar
warranties that permit the return of, or premium refund
clauses covering, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans
that qualify for a 50 percent risk weight provided the
warranty period does not exceed 120 days from the date
of transfer.
Example: A holding company sells $100 in qualify-
ing 1-4 family residential ﬁrst mortgage loans and
agrees to repurchase them in case of early default
for up to 180 days. This warranty exceeds the 120
day limit, and therefore the full $100 should be
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 17 until the
warranty expires.
If the holding company has made a CERW that is limited
or capped (e.g., a warranty to cover ﬁrst losses on loans
up to a set amount that is less than the full loan amount),
such warranties are regarded as securitization exposures
under the regulatory capital rules as they represent a
transaction that has been separated into at least two
tranches reﬂecting different levels of seniority for credit
risk. (Refer to the deﬁnitions of securitization exposure,
synthetic securitization, traditional securitization, and
tranche in §.2 of the regulatory capital rules). The
holding company will need to report and risk weight
these warranties in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 10, as
off-balance sheet securitization exposures.
Schedule HC-R
HC-R-60
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-R
March 2020

Example: A holding company sells $100 in qualify-
ing 1-4 family residential ﬁrst mortgage loans and
agrees to compensate the buyer for losses up to $2 if
the loans default during the ﬁrst 12 months. Twelve
months exceeds the 120-day limit and therefore the
agreement is a CERW. The CERW is also a securi-
tization exposure because the $2 is effectively a ﬁrst
loss tranche on a $100 transaction.
For purposes of reporting this transaction in Schedule
HC-R, Part II, item 10, the holding company should
report $100 in column A, an adjustment of $98 in column
B, and then $2 in column Q as an exposure amount that is
risk weighted by applying a 1,250 percent risk weight (if
the holding company does not use the Simpliﬁed Super-
visory Formula Approach (SSFA) or the Gross-Up
Approach for purposes of risk weighting its securitization
exposures). The holding company will not need to report
any amount in column T or U of Schedule HC-R, Part II,
item 10, unless it uses the SSFA or Gross-Up Approach
for calculating the risk weighted asset amount for this
transaction.
If the holding company uses either the SSFA or Gross-Up
Approach to risk weight the $2 exposure, the holding
company should report $100 in both column A and
column B. In columns T or U, it would report the
risk-weighted asset amount calculated by using either the
SSFA or Gross-Up Approach, respectively.
Treatment of Exposures to Sovereign Entities and
Foreign Banks
These instructions contain several references to Country
Risk Classiﬁcations (CRC) used by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The
CRC methodology classiﬁes countries into one of eight
risk categories (0-7), with countries assigned to the zero
category having the lowest possible risk assessment and
countries assigned to the 7 category having the highest
possible risk assessment. The OECD regularly updates
CRCs for more than 150 countries and makes the assess-
ments publicly available on its website.23 The OECD
does not assign a CRC to every country; for example, it
does not assign a CRC to a number of major economies;
it also does not assign a CRC to many smaller countries.
As such, the table below also provides risk weights for
countries with no CRC based on whether or not those
particular countries are members of the OECD. In addi-
tion, there is a higher risk weight of 150 percent for any
country that has defaulted on its sovereign debt within
the past 5 years, regardless of the CRC rating.
Risk weights for reported balance sheet (items 1 through
8) and off-balance sheet and other (items 12 through 22)
exposures are to be assigned based upon the tables
below:

All risk-weight categories pertaining to exposures to cen-
tral foreign governments:
• All exposures to foreign central governments may be
assigned a lower risk weight if the following conditions
are met: (1) the exposures are denominated in the
particular foreign country’s local currency; (2) the
holding company has at least equivalent liabilities in
that currency; and (3) the risk weight is not lower than
the risk weight that particular foreign country allows
under its jurisdiction to assign to the same exposures to
that country.
Summary of Risk Weights for Exposures to Govern-
ment and Public Sector Entities
The following are some of the most common exposures
to government and public sector entities and the risk
weights that apply to them:
Column C – 0%column:
• All exposures (deﬁned broadly to include securities,
loans, and leases) that are direct exposures to, or the

• Exposures that are collateralized by cash on deposit in
the reporting holding company.
• Exposures that are collateralized by securities issued or
guaranteed by the U.S. Government, or other sovereign
governments that qualify for the zero percent risk
weight. Collateral value must be adjusted under §.37 of
the regulatory capital rules.
• Exposures to, and the portions of exposures guaranteed
by, the Bank for International Settlements, the Euro-
pean Central Bank, the European Commission, the
International Monetary Fund, the European Stability
Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility,
or a multilateral development fund (as speciﬁcally
deﬁned in §.2 of the regulatory capital rules).

teed by the U.S. Government or U.S. Government
agencies. This includes exposures, or the portions of
exposures, conditionally guaranteed by the FDIC or the
NCUA.

Risk Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures
Under the regulatory capital rules, three separate
approaches are available for setting the regulatory capital
requirements for securitization exposures, as deﬁned in
§.2 of the regulatory capital rules. Securitization expo-
sures include asset-backed and mortgage-backed securi-
ties, other positions in securitization transactions,
re-securitizations, and structured ﬁnance programs24
(except credit-enhancing interest-only (CEIO) strips). In
general, under each of the three approaches, the risk-
based capital requirement for a position in a securitiza-
tion or structured ﬁnance program (hereafter referred to
collectively as a securitization) is computed by multiply-
ing the calculated amount of the position by the appropri-
ate risk weight. The three approaches to determining the
proper risk weight for a securitization exposure are the
Simpliﬁed Supervisory formula approach, the Gross-Up
Approach, or the 1,250 Percent Risk Weight Approach.
If a securitization exposure is not an after-tax gain-on-
sale resulting from a securitization that requires deduc-
tion, or the portion of a CEIO strip that does not
constitute an after-tax gain-on-sale,25 a holding company
may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure
using the SSFA if certain requirements are met. If a
holding company is not subject to Subpart F (the market
risk capital rule) of the regulatory capital rules, it may
instead choose to assign a risk weight to the securitiza-
tion exposure using the Gross-Up Approach if certain
requirements are met. However, the holding company
must apply either the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach
consistently across all of its securitization exposures.
However, if the holding company cannot, or chooses not
to, apply the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach to an
individual securitization exposure, the holding company
must assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to that exposure.
Both traditional and synthetic securitizations must meet
certain operational requirements before applying either
the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach. Furthermore, hold-
ing companies must complete certain due diligence
requirements and satisfactorily demonstrate a compre-
hensive understanding of the features of the securitiza-
tion exposure that would materially affect the perfor-
mance of the exposure. If these due diligence requirements
are not met, the holding company must assign the
24. Structured ﬁnance programs include, but are not limited to, collater-
alized debt obligations.
25. Consistent with the regulatory capital rules, a holding company
must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale
resulting from a securitization and must apply a 1,250 percent risk weight
to the portion of a CEIO strip that does not constitute an after-tax
gain-on-sale.

securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent.
The holding company’s analysis must be commensurate
with the complexity of the securitization exposure and
the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.
Holding companies should refer to §.41 of the regulatory
capital rules to review the details of these operational and
due diligence requirements.
For example, a holding company not subject to the
market risk capital rule has 12 securitization exposures.
The operational and due diligence requirements have
been met for 10 of the exposures, to which the holding
company applies the Gross-Up Approach. The holding
company then assigns a 1,250 percent risk weight to the
other two exposures. Alternatively, the holding company
could assign a 1,250 percent risk weight to all 12
securitization exposures.
a. Exposure Amount Calculation
The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitiza-
tion exposure that is not an available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity security where the holding company has made
the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)
opt-out election in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a), a
repo-style transaction, an eligible margin loan, an over-
the-counter (OTC) derivative contract, or a cleared trans-
action is equal to the carrying value of the exposure.
The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitiza-
tion exposure that is an available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity security where the holding company has made
the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule HC-R, Part I,
item 3.a, is equal to the carrying value of the exposure
(including any accrued interest receivable on the expo-
sure reported in Schedule HC, item 11), less any net
unrealized gains on the exposure and plus any net
unrealized losses on the exposure.
The exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitiza-
tion exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, an
eligible margin loan, a cleared transaction (other than a
credit derivative), an OTC derivative contract (other than
a credit derivative), or an exposure to an asset-backed
commercial paper (ABCP) program is the notional
amount of the exposure.
For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure to an
asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) program, such
as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional
amount may be reduced to the maximum potential
amount that the holding company could be required to
fund given the ABCP program’s current underlying
assets (calculated without regard to the current credit
quality of those assets). An exposure amount of an
eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does
not apply is calculated by multiplying the notional
amount of the exposure by a CCF of 50 percent. An
exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility
for which the SSFA does apply is calculated by multiply-
ing the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 100
percent.
Exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a
repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or derivative
contract (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure
amount of the transaction as calculated using the instruc-
tions for calculating the exposure amount of derivatives
outlined in §.34, §.132 or §.37, respectively, of the
regulatory capital rules.
If a holding company has multiple securitization expo-
sures that provide duplicative coverage to the underlying
exposures of a securitization, the holding company is not
required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the
overlapping position. Instead, the holding company may
apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-
based capital treatment that results in the highest risk-
based capital requirement.
If a holding company provides support to a securitization
in excess of the holding company’s contractual obliga-
tion to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit
support) it must include in risk-weighted assets all of the
underlying exposures associated with the securitization
as if the exposures had not been securitized and must
deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax
gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization.
b. Simpliﬁed Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA)
To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a
securitization exposure, a holding company must have
data that enables it to accurately assign the parameters.
The data used to assign the parameters must be the most
currently available data and no more than 91 calendar
days old. A holding company that does not have the
appropriate data to assign the parameters must assign a
risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure. See the
operational requirements outlined in §.43 of the regula-
tory capital rules for further instructions.
To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure
using the SSFA, a holding company must have accurate
Schedule HC-R
FR Y-9C
HC-R-65
Schedule HC-R
March 2020

information on the following ﬁve inputs to the SSFA
calculation:
• Parameter KG is the weighted-average total capital
requirement for all underlying exposures calculated
using the SSFA (with unpaid principal used as the
weight for each exposure). Parameter KG is expressed
as a decimal value between zero and one (e.g., an
average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value
of KG equal to .08). ‘‘Underlying exposures’’ is deﬁned
in the regulatory capital rules to mean one or more
exposures that have been securitized in a securitization
transaction. In this regard, underlying exposures means
all exposures, including performing and nonperform-
ing exposures. Thus, for example, for a pool of under-
lying corporate exposures that have been securitized,
where 95 percent of the pool is performing (and qualify
for a risk weight of 100 percent) and 5 percent of the
pool is past due exposures that are not guaranteed and
are unsecured (and thus are assigned a risk weight of
150 percent), the weighted risk weight for the pool
would be 102.5 percent [102.5% = (95% * 100%) +
(5% * 150%)] and the total capital requirement KG
would be equal to 0.082 (102.5% divided by 1,250%).
This treatment is consistent with the regulatory capital
rules.
• Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar
amounts of any underlying exposures within the secu-
ritized pool to the ending balance, measured in dollars,
of underlying exposures, that meet any of the following
criteria: (1) 90 days or more past due; (2) subject to a
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding; (3) in the pro-
cess of foreclosure; (4) held as real estate owned; (5)
has contractually deferred interest payments for 90
days or more (other than in the case of deferments on
federally guaranteed student loans and certain con-
sumer loans deferred according to provisions in the
contract); or (6) is in default. Parameter W is expressed
as a decimal value between zero and one.
As a result, past due exposures that also meet one or more
of the criteria in parameter W are to be factored into the
measure of both parameters KG and W for purposes of
calculating the regulatory capital requirement for securi-
tization exposures using the SSFA.
• Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure,
which represents the threshold at which credit losses
will ﬁrst be allocated to the exposure. Parameter A
equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of under-
lying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure
of the holding company to the current dollar amount of
underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by
the accumulated cash ﬂows from the underlying expo-
sures that is subordinated to the holding company’s
securitization exposure may be included in the calcula-
tion of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in
the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal
value between zero and one.
• Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure,
which represents the threshold at which credit losses of
principal allocated to the exposure would result in a
total loss of principal. Parameter D equals parameter A
plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the
securitization exposures that are pari passu with the
exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to
credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the under-
lying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal
value between zero and one.
• A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5
for securitization exposures that are not resecuritiza-
tion exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization
exposures.
There are three steps to calculating the risk weight for a
securitization using the SSFA. First, a holding company
must complete the following equations using the previ-
ously described parameters:
KA = (1–W) . KG + ( 0.5 . W)
a = –
1
p . KA
u = D – KA
l = max(A- KA, 0)
e = 2.71828, the base of the natural logarithms
Second, using the variables calculated in ﬁrst step, ﬁnd
the value of KSSFA using the formula below:
KSSFA =
ea.u – ea.l
a(u – l)
Third, the risk weight of any particular securitization
exposure (expressed as a percent) will depend on the
tranche’s attachment point and detachment point relative
to KA:
Schedule HC-R
HC-R-66
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-R
June 2020

Case 1: If the detachment point, parameter D, is less than
or equal to KA, the exposure is assigned a risk weight of
1,250 percent.
Case 2: If the attachment point, parameter A, is less than
KA and the detachment point, parameter D, is greater
than KA, the risk weight is a weighted average of 1,250
percent and 1,250 percent times KSSFA, calculated as
shown below:
Case 3: If the attachment point, parameter A, is greater
than or equal to KA, the risk weight is the product of
KSSFA and 1,250 percent, as shown in the following
equation:
To determine the risk-based capital requirement under
the SSFA, multiply the exposure amount by the higher of
either (1) the calculated risk weight or (2) a 20 percent
risk weight.
For purposes of reporting in Schedule HC-R, Part II,
items 9 and 10, a holding company would report in
Column T the risk-weighted asset amount calculated
under the SSFA for its securitization exposures.
c. Gross-Up Approach
A holding company that is not subject to the market risk
capital rule (Subpart F) in the regulatory capital rules
may apply the gross-up approach instead of the SSFA to
determine the risk weight of its securitization exposures,
provided that it applies the gross-up approach consis-
tently to all of its securitization exposures.
To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure
using the gross-up approach, a holding company must
calculate the following four inputs:
(1) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the holding
company’s securitization exposure as a percent of the
par value of the tranche in which the securitization
exposure resides.
(2) Enhanced amount, which is the par value of the
tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which
the holding company’s securitization resides.
(3) Exposure amount of the holding company’s securiti-
zation exposure.
(4) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk
weight of underlying exposures in the securitization
pool.
The holding company would calculate the credit equiva-
lent amount which is equal to the sum of the exposure
amount of the holding company’s securitization exposure
(3) and the pro rata share (1) multiplied by the enhanced
amount (2).
A holding company must assign the higher of the
weighted-average risk weight (4) or a 20 percent risk
weight to the securitization exposure using the gross-up
approach.
To determine the risk-based capital requirement under
the gross-up approach, multiply the higher of the two risk
weights by the credit equivalent amount. These steps are
outlined in the worksheet below:
Gross-Up Approach Worksheet to Calculate the
Capital Charge for a Securitization Exposure that is
Not a Senior Exposure26
(a) Currently outstanding par value of the
holding company’s non-senior
securitization exposure divided by the
currently outstanding par value of the
entire tranche (e.g., 60%27 ).................
26. A senior securitization exposure means a securitization exposure
that has a ﬁrst priority claim on the cash ﬂows from the underlying
exposures, without considering amounts due under interest rate or currency
contracts, fees or other similar payments due. Time tranching (that is,
maturity differences) also is not considered when determining whether a
securitization exposure is a senior securitization exposure.
27. For example, if the currently outstanding par value of the entire
tranche is $100 and the currently outstanding par value of the holding
company’s subordinated security is $60, then the holding company would
enter 60% in (a).

For purposes of reporting its non-senior securitization
exposures in Schedule HC-R, Part II, items 9 and 10, a
holding company would report in Column U the risk-
weighted asset amount calculated in line (g) on the
Gross-Up Approach worksheet. For a senior securitiza-
tion exposure, a holding company would report in col-
umn U the face amount of its exposure29 multiplied by
the weighted-average risk weight of the securitization’s
underlying exposures, subject to a 20 percent risk-weight
ﬂoor.
Reporting in Schedule HC-R, Part II, When Using the
Gross-Up Approach:
If the holding company’s non-senior security is a held-to-
maturity securitization exposure, the amortized cost of
this security is included on the Report of Condition
balance sheet in Schedule HC, item 2(a), ‘‘Held-to-
maturity securities,’’ and on the regulatory capital sched-
ule in columns A and B of Schedule HC-R, Part II, item
9(a), ‘‘On-balance sheet securitization exposures - Held-
to-maturity securities.’’ The risk-weighted asset amount
from line (g) in the Gross-Up Approach Worksheet above
is reported in column U of Schedule HC-R, Part II, item
9(a).
If the holding company’s non-senior security is an
available-for-sale securitization exposure, the fair value
of this security is included on the Report of Condition
balance sheet in Schedule HC, item 2(b), “Available-for-
sale securities,” and on the regulatory capital schedule in
column A of Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 9(b), ‘‘On-
balance sheet securitization exposures - Available-for-
sale securities.’’ For further information on the reporting
of AFS securitization exposures in column B refer to the
instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 9(b) because
the amount reported in column B depends on whether the
holding company has made the AOCI opt-out election in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a). For non-senior AFS
securitization exposures, the risk-weighted asset amount
from line (g) in the Gross-Up Approach Worksheet above
is reported in column U of Schedule HC-R, Part II, item
9(b).
If the holding company’s subordinated security is a
trading securitization exposure, the fair value of this
security is included on the Report of Condition balance
sheet in Schedule HC, item 5, ‘‘Trading assets,’’ and on
the regulatory capital schedule in column A of Schedule
HC-R, Part II, item 9(c), ‘‘On-balance sheet securitiza-
tion exposures - Trading assets that receive standardized
charges.’’ A trading security is risk-weighted using its
fair value if the holding company is not subject to the
market risk capital rule. The risk-weighted asset amount
from line (g) in the Gross-Up Approach Worksheet above
is reported in column U of Schedule HC-R, Part II,
item 9(c).
28. For risk-based capital purposes, if the holding company has made
the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a), the “face
amount” of an available-for-sale security and a held-to-maturity security is
its amortized cost; the “face amount” of a trading security is its fair value.
If the holding company has not made or cannot make the AOCI opt-out
election, the “face amount” of an HTM security is its amortized cost; the
“face amount” of an AFS security or a trading security is its fair value.

d. 1,250 Percent Risk Weight Approach
If the holding company cannot, or chooses not to apply
the SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach to the securitization
exposure, the holding company must assign a 1,250
percent risk weight to the exposure.
Securitization exposure reporting in Schedule HC-R,
Part II
Securitization exposure reporting depends on the meth-
odology the holding company will use to risk weight the
exposure
.
For example, if a holding company plans to apply the
1,250 percent risk weight to its exposures, the amount
reported in column Q should match the amount reported
in column A (less any adjustments, such as that for an
allocated transfer risk reserve (ATRR)). For any securiti-
zation exposure risk-weighted using the 1,250 percent
risk weight, the sum of columns B and Q should equal
column A.

In addition, when a holding company aplies the 1,250
percent risk weight to an on-balance sheet securitization
exposure, the holding company should include in column
A of Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 9.d, any amount
reported in Schedule HC, item 11, ‘‘Other assets,’’ for
accrued interest receivable on the securitization expo-
sures, regardless of where the securitization exposure is
reported on the balance sheet in Schedule HC. The
amount reported in column Q should match the amount
reported in column A.
If a holding company - regardless if it makes the AOCI
opt-out election - is applying the SSFA or Gross-Up
Approach, the reporting is signiﬁcantly different due to
the fact that the holding company reports the risk
weighted assets amount in columns T or U.
In the case where a holding company has a securitization
exposure with a balance sheet value of $100, it would
report $100 in both columns A and B. If the holding
company applies the SSFA and calculates a risk-weighted
asset exposure of $20 for that securitization, the holding
company would report $20 in column T. Since it is using
the SSFA for all its securitization exposures, the holding
company must report $0 in column U.
A holding company, at its discretion, could also use both
the 1,250 percent risk weight for some securitization
exposures and either the SSFA or Gross-Up Approach for
other securitization exposures. For example, Holding
Company Z has three securitization exposures, each
valued at $100 on the balance sheet. Holding Company Z
chooses to apply the 1,250 percent risk weight to one
exposure and use the Gross-Up Approach to calculate
risk-weighted assets for the other two exposures. Assume
that the risk-weighted asset amount under the Gross-Up
Approach is $20 for each exposure.

The holding company would report the following:
The $200 reported under column B reﬂects the balance

using the Gross-Up Approach. This ensures that the sum
of columns B and Q continue to equal the amount
reported in column A. The $40 under column U reﬂects
the risk-weighted asset amount of the sum of the two
securitization exposures that were risk-weighted using
the Gross-Up Approach. This $40 is added to total
risk-weighted assets in item 28 of Schedule HC-R,
Part II.
Holding Companies That Are Subject to the Market
Risk Capital Rule
The regulatory capital rules require all holding compa-
nies with signiﬁcant market risk to measure their market
risk exposure and hold sufficient capital to mitigate this
exposure. In general, a holding company is subject to the
market risk capital rule if its consolidated trading activ-
ity, deﬁned as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as
reported in its FR Y9-C for the previous quarter, equals:(1)
10 percent or more of the holding company’s total assets
as reported in its FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2)
$1 billion or more. However, the Federal Reserve may
exempt or include the holding company if necessary or
appropriate for safe and sound banking practices.
A holding company that is subject to the market risk
capital rule must hold capital to support its exposure to
general market risk arising from ﬂuctuations in interes-
trates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, and com-
modity prices and its exposure to speciﬁc risk associated
with certain debt and equity positions.
A covered position is a trading asset or trading liability
(whether on- or off-balance sheet), as reported on Sched-
ule HC-D, that is held for any of the following reasons:
(1) For the purpose of short-term resale;
(2) With the intent of beneﬁting from actual or expected
short-term price movements;
(3) To lock in arbitrage proﬁts; or
(4) To hedge another covered position.
Schedule HC-R
HC-R-70
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-R
December 2015

Covered positions include all positions in a holding
company’s trading account and foreign exchange and
commodity positions, whether or not in the trading
account. Covered positions generally should not be risk-
weighted as part of the holding company’s gross credit
risk-weighted assets. However, foreign exchange posi-
tions that are outside of the trading account and all
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives as well as cleared
transactions and unsettled transactions continue to have a
counterparty credit risk capital charge. Those positions
are included in both gross risk-weighted assets for credit
risk and the holding company’s covered positions for
market risk.
Additionally, the trading asset or trading liability must be
free of any restrictive covenants on its tradability or the
holding company must be able to hedge the material risk
elements of the trading asset or trading liability in a
two-way market. A covered position also includes a
foreign exchange or commodity position, regardless of
whether the position is a trading asset or trading liability
(excluding structural foreign currency positions if super-
visory approval has been granted to exclude such posi-
tions).
A covered position does not include:
(1) An intangible asset (including any servicing asset);
(2) A hedge of a trading position that is outside the scope
of the holding company’s hedging strategy (required
by the market risk capital rule);
(3) Any position that, in form or substance, acts as a
liquidity facility that provides support to asset-
backed commercial paper;
(4) A credit derivative recognized as a guarantee for
risk-weighted asset calculation purposes under the
regulatory capital rules for credit risk;
(5) An equity position that is not publicly traded (other
than a derivative that references a publicly traded
equity);
(6) A position held with the intent to securitize; or
(7) A direct real estate holding.
A holding company subject to the market risk capital rule
must maintain an overall minimum 8.0 percent ratio of
total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier
2 capital, net of all deductions) to the sum of risk-
weighted assets and market risk-weighted assets. Hold-
ing companies should refer to the regulatory capital rules
for speciﬁc instructions on the calculation of the measure
for market risk.
Balance Sheet Asset Categories
Treatment of Embedded Derivatives - If a holding com-
pany has a hybrid contract containing an embedded
derivative that must be separated from the host contract
and accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC
Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly FASB
Statement No. 133, ‘‘Accounting for Derivative Instru-
ments and Hedging Activities,’’ as amended), then the
host contract and embedded derivative should be treated
separately for risk-based capital purposes. When the fair
value of the embedded derivative has been reported as
part of the holding company’s assets on Schedule HC -
Balance Sheet, that fair value (whether positive or nega-
tive) should be reported (as a positive or negative num-
ber) in column B of the corresponding asset category
item in Schedule HC-R, Part II (items 1 to 8). The host
contract, if an asset, should be risk weighted according to
the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of
the collateral. All derivative exposures should be risk-
weighted in the derivative items of Schedule HC-R, Part
II, as appropriate (items 20 or 21).
Reporting Exposures Hedged with Cleared Eligible
Credit Derivatives
Holding companies are able to obtain full or partial
protection for (i.e., “hedge”) on-balance sheet assets or
off-balance sheet items using credit derivatives that are
cleared through a qualiﬁed central counterparty (QCCP)
or a central counterparty (CCP) that is not a QCCP. In
some cases, a cleared credit derivative used for this
purpose meets the deﬁnition of an eligible credit deriva-
tive in §.2 of the regulatory capital rules. In these cases,
under §.36 of the regulatory capital rules, a holding
company that is a clearing member or a clearing member
client may recognize the credit risk mitigation beneﬁts of
the eligible credit derivative. More speciﬁcally, the risk
weight of the underlying exposure (e.g., 20 percent, 50
percent, or 100 percent) may be replaced with the risk
weight of the CCP or QCCP as the protection provider if
the credit derivative is an eligible credit derivative, is
cleared through a CCP or a QCCP, and meets the
applicable requirements under §.35 and §.36 of the
regulatory capital rules. The risk weight for an eligible
credit derivative cleared through a QCCP is 2 percent or
4 percent, based on conditions set forth in the rules. The
Schedule HC-R
FR Y-9C
HC-R-71
Schedule HC-R
December 2015

risk weight for an eligible credit derivative cleared
through a CCP is determined according to §.32 of the
regulatory capital rules. In addition, the coverage amount
provided by an eligible credit derivative must be adjusted
downward under certain conditions as described in §.36
of the regulatory capital rules.
If a clearing member holding company or clearing mem-
ber client holding company has obtained full or partial
protection for an on-balance sheet asset or off-balance
sheet item using a cleared eligible credit derivative
cleared through a QCCP, the holding company may, but
is not required to, recognize the beneﬁts of this eligible
credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset
amount for the hedged exposure in Schedule HC-R, Part
II, by reporting the protected exposure amounts and
credit equivalent amounts in the 2 percent or 4 percent
risk-weight category, as appropriate under the regulatory
capital rules. Any amount of the exposure that is not
covered by the eligible credit derivative should be
reported in the risk-weight category corresponding to the
risk weight of the underlying exposure. For example, for
an asset with a $200 exposure amount fully covered by
an eligible credit derivative cleared through a QCCP that
qualiﬁes for a 2 percent risk weight, the holding company
would report the $200 exposure amount in Column
D–2% risk weight for the appropriate asset category.
Treatment of Certain Centrally Cleared Derivative
Contracts
In August 2017, the banking agencies issued supervisory
guidance on the regulatory capital treatment of certain
centrally cleared derivative contracts which are reported
in HC-R Part II item 21, in light of revisions to the
rulebooks of certain central counterparties. Under the
previous requirements of these central counterparties’
rulebooks, variation margin transferred to cover the
exposure that arises from marking cleared derivative
contracts, and netting sets of such contracts, to fair value
was considered collateral pledged by one party to the
other, with title to the collateral remaining with the
posting party. These derivative contracts are referred to
as collateralized-to-market contracts. Under the revised
rulebooks of certain central counterparties, variation mar-
gin for certain centrally cleared derivative contracts, and
certain netting sets of such contracts, is considered a
settlement payment for the exposure that arises from
marking these derivative contracts and netting sets to fair
value, with title to the payment transferring to the
receiving party. In these circumstances, the derivative
contracts and netting sets are referred to as settled-to-
market contracts.
Irrespective of the classiﬁcation discussed above, under
the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, a
holding company may elect to treat derivative contracts
as collateralized-to-market derivative contracts subject to
a variation margin agreement and apply the maturity
factor for derivative contracts subject to a variation
margin agreement. A holding company that elects to
apply this treatment must apply the maturity factor
applicable to margined derivative contracts.
Under the Board’s regulatory capital rules, in general, a
holding company must calculate the trade exposure
amount for a cleared derivative contract, or a netting set
of such contracts, by using the methodology described in
§.34 of the rules to determine (i) the current credit
exposure and (ii) the potential future exposure (PFE) of
the derivative contract or netting set of such contracts for
purposes of the standardized approach risk-based capital
calculation and the supplementary leverage ratio calcula-
tion when using the Current Exposure Method (CEM) or
by using the methodology described in §.132 of the rules
to determine (i) the replacement cost and (ii) the potential
future exposure of the derivative contract or netting set of
such contracts for purposes of the standardized approach
risk-based capital calculation and the supplementary
leverage ratio calculations when using the Standardized
Approach—Counterparty Credit Risk Method (SA-CCR).
The risk-weighted asset calculations under the advanced
approaches capital framework have similar requirements.
Under CEM, current credit exposure is determined by
reference to the fair value of each derivative contract as
measured under U.S. GAAP. Potential future exposure is
determined, in part, by multiplying each derivative con-
tract’s notional principal amount by a conversion factor.
The conversion factors vary by the category (for exam-
ple, interest rate, equity) and remaining maturity of the
derivative contract.30
Under SA-CCR, the determination of the replacement
cost depends on whether the counterparty to a holding
company is required to post variation margin. The
replacement cost for a netting set that is not subject to a
variation margin agreement is equal to the greater of (1)
30. See the instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 21, “Centrally
cleared derivatives,” for a chart of the credit conversion factors.
Schedule HC-R
HC-R-72

Schedule HC-R

the sum of the fair values (after excluding any valuation
adjustments) of the derivative contracts within the netting
set, less the net independent collateral amount applicable
to such derivative contracts, or (2) zero. For a netting set
that is subject to a variation margin agreement where the
counterparty is required to post variation margin, replace-
ment cost is equal to the greater of (1) the sum of the fair
values (after excluding any valuation adjustments) of the
derivative contracts within the netting set, less the sum of
the net independent collateral amount and the variation
margin amount applicable to such derivative contracts;
(2) the sum of the variation margin threshold and the
minimum transfer amount applicable to the derivative
contracts within the netting set, less the net independent
collateral amount applicable to such derivative contracts;
or (3) zero. The SA-CCR PFE is equal to the product of
the PFE multiplier and the aggregated amount. To deter-
mine the aggregated amount, a holding company is
required to determine the hedging set amounts for the
derivative contracts within a netting set, where a hedging
set is comprised of derivative contracts that share similar
risk factors based on asset class (e.g., interest rate,
exchange rate, credit, equity, and commodity).
The regulatory capital rules provide that, for a derivative
contract that is structured such that on speciﬁed dates any
outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so
that the fair value of the contract is zero, the remaining
maturity equals the time until the next reset date.
For the purpose of the regulatory capital rules, the
August 2017 supervisory guidance states that if, after
accounting and legal analysis, a holding company deter-
mines that (i) the variation margin payment on a centrally
cleared settled-to-market contract settles any outstanding
exposure on the contract. In conducting its legal analysis
to determine whether variation margin may be consid-
ered settlement of outstanding exposure under the regu-
latory capital rules, a holding company should evaluate
whether the transferor of the variation margin has relin-
quished all legal claims to the variation margin and
whether the payment of variation margin constitutes
settlement under the central counterparty’s rulebook, any
other applicable agreements governing the derivative
contract, and applicable law. Among other requirements,
a central counterparty’s rulebook may require an institu-
tion to satisfy additional obligations, such as payment of
other expenses and fees, in order to recognize payment of
variation margin as satisfying settlement under the rule-
book. The legal and accounting analysis performed by
the institution should take all such requirements into
account.
When using the SA-CCR method, a holding company
may elect to treat settled-to-market derivatives contracts
as subject to a variation margin agreement and receive
the beneﬁts of netting with collateralized-to-market
derivative contracts. If a holding company elects to treat
settled-to-market derivative contracts as subject to a
variation margin agreement, it must apply the maturity
factor to such contracts under §.132(c)(9)(iv)(A) of the
rules. The maturity factor of a derivative contract that is
subject to a variation margin agreement, excluding
derivative contracts that are subject to a variation margin
agreement under which the counterparty is not required
to post variation margin, is determined by the following
formula:
where MPOR refers to the period from the most recent
exchange of collateral under a variation margin agree-
ment with a defaulting counterparty until the derivative
contracts are closed out and the resulting market risk is
re-hedged.
Holding companies should refer to the supervisory guid-
ance in its entirety for purposes of determining the
appropriate regulatory capital treatment of settled-to-
market contracts under the regulatory capital rules.
Treatment of FDIC Loss-Sharing Agreements - Loss-
sharing agreements entered into by the FDIC with acquir-
ers of assets from failed institutions are considered
conditional guarantees for risk-based capital purposes
due to contractual conditions that acquirers must meet.
The guaranteed portion of assets subject to a loss-sharing
agreement may be assigned a 20 percent risk weight.
Because the structural arrangements for these agreements
vary depending on the speciﬁc terms of each agreement,
holding companies should consult with their Federal
Reserve Bank to determine the appropriate risk-based
capital treatment for speciﬁc loss-sharing agreements.
Allocated Transfer Risk Reserve (ATRR) - If the report-
ing holding company is required to establish and main-
tain an ATRR as speciﬁed in Section 905(a) of the
International Lending Supervision Act of 1983, the

ATRR should be reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II,
item 30. The ATRR is not eligible for inclusion in either
tier 1 or tier 2 capital.
Any ATRR related to loans and leases held for invest-
ment is included on the balance sheet in Schedule HC,
item 4(c), “Allowance for credit losses on loans and
leases,” and separately disclosed in Schedule HI-B,
part II, Memorandum item 1. However, if the holding
company must maintain an ATRR for any asset other
than a loan or lease held for investment, the balance sheet
category for that asset should be reported net of the
ATRR on Schedule HC. In this situation, the ATRR
should be reported as a negative number (i.e., with a
minus (-) sign) in column B, ‘‘Adjustments to totals
reported in Column A,’’ of the corresponding asset
category in Schedule HC-R, Part II, items 1 through 4
and 7 through 9. The amount to be risk-weighted for this
asset in columns C through Q, as appropriate, would be
its net carrying value plus the ATRR. For example, a
holding company has a held-to-maturity security issued
by a foreign commercial company against which it has
established an ATRR of $20. The security, net of the
ATRR, is included in Schedule HC, item 2(a), ‘‘Held-to-
maturity securities,’’ at $80. The security should be
included in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 2(a), column A,
at $80. The holding company should include $-20 in

item 2(a), column I.

Exposure amounts to be used for purposes of
risk weighting by a holding company that
cannot or has not made the Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) opt-
out election in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item
3(a):
For a security reported in Schedule HC-R,
Part II, item 2(b), column A where the hold-
ing company cannot or has not made the
AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is
included in regulatory capital), the exposure
amount to be risk-weighted by holding com-
pany is:
• For debt securities: the carrying value,
which is the value of the asset reported
on the balance sheet of the holding com-
pany determined in accordance with
GAAP (i.e., the fair value of the available-
for-sale debt security) and in column A.
• For equity securities and preferred
stock classiﬁed as an equity under
GAAP: the adjusted carrying value.31
Exposure amounts to be used for purposes
of risk weighting by a holding company
that has made the AOCI opt-out election in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a):
For a security reported in Schedule HC-R,
Part II, item 2(b) column A, where the
holding company has made the AOCI opt-
out election (i.e., most AOCI is not included
in regulatory capital), the exposure amount
to be risk weighted by the holding company
is:
• For a debt security: the carrying value,
less any unrealized gain on the exposure
or plus any unrealized loss on the expo-
sure included in AOCI.
• For equity securities and preferred
stock classiﬁed as an equity under
GAAP with readily determinable fair
values: the adjusted carrying value.32
• In column B, a holding company that has
made the AOCI opt-out election should
include the difference between the fair
value and amortized cost of those AFS
debt securities that do not qualify as
securitization exposures. This difference
equals the amounts reported in Schedule
HC-B, items 1 through 6, column D,
minus items 1 through 6, column C, for
31. Adjusted carrying value applies only to equity exposures and is
deﬁned in §.51 of the regulatory capital rules. In general, it includes an
on-balance sheet amount as well as application of conversion factors to
determine on-balance sheet equivalents of any off-balance sheet commit-
ments to acquire equity exposures. For holding companies that cannot or
have not made the AOCI opt-out election, the on-balance sheet component
is equal to the carrying value. Refer to §.51 for the precise deﬁnition.
32. Adjusted carrying value applies only to equity exposures and is

on-balance sheet amount as well as application of conversion factors to
determine on-balance sheet equivalents of any off-balance sheet commit-
ments to acquire equity exposures. For holding companies that have made

those AFS debt securities included in
these items that are not securitization
exposures.
o When fair value exceeds cost, report the differ-
ence as a positive number in Schedule HC-R,
Part II, item 2(b), column B.
o When cost exceeds fair value, report the differ-
ence as a negative number (i.e., with a minus
(-) sign) in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 2(b),
column B.
Example: A holding company reports an AFS
debt security that is a not a securitization expo-
sure on its balance sheet in Schedule HC, item
2(b), at a carrying value (i.e., fair value) of $105.
The amortized cost of the debt security is $100.
The holding company has made the AOCI opt-
out election in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a).
The AFS debt security has a $5 unrealized gain
that is included in AOCI. In Schedule HC-R, Part
II, item 2(b), the holding company would report:
o $105 in column A. This is the carrying value
of the AFS debt security on the bank’s balance
sheet.
o $5 in column B. This is the difference between
the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the debt
security and its exposure amount that is sub-
ject to risk-weighting. For holding companies
that has made the AOCI opt-out election,
column B will typically represent the amount
of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss on the
security. Gains are reported as positive num-
bers; losses as negative numbers. (Note: if the
holding company has not made or cannot
make the AOCI opt-out election, there will not
be an adjustment to be reported in column B.)
o $100 is the exposure amount subject to risk
weight loss. This amount will be reported
under the appropriate risk weight associated
with the exposure (columns C through J). For
holding companies that have made AOCI opt-
out election, the exposure amount typically
will be the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of
the debt security excluding any unrealized
gain or loss.
• In column B, for a holding company that has
made the AOCI opt-out election, no amount
should be included for equity securities and
preferred stock classiﬁed as an equity under
GAAP with readily determinable fair values that
are reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item
2(b), column A.
• In column B for non-advanced approaches hold-
ing companies, include the amount of:
o Investments in the capital of unconsolidated
ﬁnancial institutions that are reported in Sched-
ule HC, item 2(c), and have been deducted
from capital in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item
13.a, item 24, and item 43.
• In column B for advanced approaches holding
companies, include the amount of:
o Non-signiﬁcant investments in the capital and
covered debt instruments of unconsolidated
ﬁnancial institutions that are reported in Sched-
ule HC, item 2(c), and have been deducted
from capital in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 11,
item 17, item 24, and item 43.
o Signiﬁcant investments in the capital of uncon-
solidated ﬁnancial institutions in the form of
tier 2 capital and covered debt instruments,
that are reported in Schedule HC, item 2(c),
and have been deducted from capital in Sched-
ule HC-R, Part I, item 17, item 24 and item 43.
o Investments in nonqualifying excluded cov-
ered debt instruments that are reported in
Schedule HC, item 2(c), and have been
deducted from capital in Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 17, item 24, and item 43.
o Signiﬁcant investments in the capital of uncon-
solidated ﬁnancial institutions in the form of
common
stock,
reported

Agricultural land;
(ii) The acquisition or reﬁnance of existing income-producing real
property secured by a mortgage on such property, if the cash ﬂow
being generated by the real property is sufficient to support the
debt service and expenses of the real property, in accordance
with the institution’s applicable loan underwriting criteria for
permanent ﬁnancings;
(iii) Improvements to existing income-producing improved real prop-
erty secured by a mortgage on such property, if the cash ﬂow
being generated by the real property is sufficient to support the
debt service and expenses of the real property, in accordance
with the institution’s applicable loan underwriting criteria for
permanent ﬁnancings; or
(iv) Commercial real property projects in which—
(A)
The loan-to-value ratio is less than or equal to the applica-
ble maximum supervisory loan-to-value ratio as deter-
mined by an institution’s primary federal regulator;
(B)
The borrower has contributed capital of at least 15 per-
cent of the real property’s appraised, ′as completed’ value
to the project in the form of—
(1)
Cash;
(2)
Unencumbered readily marketable assets;
(3)
Paid development expenses out-of-pocket; or
(4)
Contributed real property or improvements; and
(C)
The borrower contributed the minimum amount of capital
described under paragraph (2)(iv)(B) of this deﬁnition
before the institution advances funds (other than the
advance of a nominal sum made in order to secure the
institution’s lien against the real property) under the credit

haircut
approach, respectively; however, the
holding company must apply the same
approach for all eligible margin loans.
In addition, if the holding company
applies the simple approach, it must
apply the same approach to securitiza-
tion exposure collateral - either the Sim-
pliﬁed Supervisory Formula Approach
or the Gross-Up Approach - that it
applies to determine the risk-weighted

Compensation-
Retirement Beneﬁts - Deﬁned Beneﬁt Plans-
General (formerly FASB Statement No. 158,
‘‘Employers’ Accounting for Deﬁned Beneﬁt
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans’’), the
holding company should adjust the asset
amount reported in column A of this item for
any amounts included in Schedule HC, item
26(b), ‘‘Accumulated other comprehensive
income’’, affecting assets as a result of the
initial and subsequent application of the funded
status and measurement date provisions of
ASC Subtopic 715-20. The adjustment also
should take into account subsequent amortiza-
tion of these amounts from AOCI into earn-
ings. The intent of the adjustment reported in
this item (together with the amount reported
in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 9(d)) is to
reverse the effects on AOCI of applying ASC
Subtopic 715-20 for regulatory capital pur-
poses. Speciﬁcally, assets recognized or derec-
ognized as an adjustment to AOCI as part of
the incremental effect of applying ASC Sub-
topic 715-20 should be reported as an adjust-
ment to assets in column B of this item. For
example, the derecognition of an asset
recorded as an offset to AOCI as part of the
initial incremental effect of applying ASC
Subtopic 715-20 should be reported in this
item as a negative amount in column B and as
a positive amount in column I. As another
example, the portion of a beneﬁt plan surplus
asset that is included in Schedule HC,
item 26(b), as an increase to AOCI and in
column A of this item should be excluded
from risk-weighted assets by reporting the
amount as a positive number in column B of
this item.

• Note: The fair value of derivative
contracts reported as assets in Sched-
ule HC, item 11, that are neither over-
the-counter derivative contracts nor

transactions under §.2 of the regula-
tory capital rules should not be
reported in column B. Such derivative
contracts include written option con-
tracts, including so-called “derivative

• In columns R and S of item 8.b-Default
Fund Contributions to Central Counterpar-
ties
Note: Item 8(b) only applies to holding
companies that are clearing members, and
therefore will not be applicable to the vast
majority of holding companies. Holding
companies
must
report
the
aggregate
on-balance sheet amount of default fund
contributions
to
central
counterparties
(CCPs) in column A. Holding companies
must report the aggregate off-balance sheet
amount, if any, of default fund contribu-
tions to central counterparties as a negative
amount in column B of item 8. Holding
companies must report the aggregate on-
and off-balance sheet amount of such con-
tributions in column R. See §.35(d) of the
regulatory capital rules for more details.
Clearing Member holding companies must
report in column S the total amount of
risk-weighted assets (RWAs) for a clearing
member holding company’s default fund
contributions to central counterparties. This
will be the sum of:
o Component A: the sum of risk-weighted
assets for a clearing member holding
company’s default fund contributions to
all non-qualifying CCPs; and,
o Component B: the sum of risk-weighted
assets for a clearing member holding
company’s default fund contributions to
all qualifying central counterparties
(QCCPs).
Report the sum of Components A and B in
Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 8(b), col-
umn S.
Component A: risk-weighted asset amount
for default fund contributions to non-
qualifying CCPs
As required by §.35(d)(2) of the regulatory
capital rules, a clearing member holding
company’s risk-weighted asset amount for
default fund contributions to CCPs that are
not QCCPs equals the sum of such default
fund contributions multiplied by 1,250 per-
cent, or an amount determined by the hold-
ing company’s federal supervisor based on
factors such as size, structure and member-
ship characteristics of the CCP and riski-
ness of its transactions, in cases where such
default fund contributions may be unlim-
ited. Therefore, unless otherwise advised
by its supervisor or through agency-issued
guidance, a holding company will sum
each of its non-QCCP default fund contri-
butions, and multiply the total by 1,250
percent, and add any additional risk-
weighted asset amount determined by the
agency, if any. This will be Component A
above.
Component B: risk-weighted asset amount
for default fund contributions to QCCPs
A clearing member holding company’s
risk-weighted asset amount for default fund
contributions to QCCPs equals the sum of
its capital requirement, KCM for each
QCCP, as calculated under the methodol-
ogy set forth §.35(d)(3) or §.133(d) of the
regulatory capital rules.
When a holding company uses CEM to
determine the risk-weighted asset of its
default fund contributions, the regulatory
capital rule provides two methods to deter-
mine the capital requirement for a clearing
member holding company’s default fund
contributions to a QCCP. A clearing mem-
ber holding company may use either
method. A clearing member holding com-
pany’s risk-weighted asset amount for
default fund contributions to a QCCP equals
the sum of its capital requirement, KCM,
for
each
QCCP
as
calculated
under
Method 1 multiplied by 1,250 percent, or
under Method 2.
Method 1: The holding company calculates
the capital charge for a clearing member in
Schedule HC-R
HC-R-110
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-R
March 2016

a 3-step process, depending on the funded
status of the QCCP. The process is summa-
rized brieﬂy below:
• Step 1: The holding company must calcu-
late the hypothetical capital requirement
of all the trades conducted through the
QCCP as if the QCCP were a bank. This
depends on the type of trade and netting
sets with each counterparty. Alternately,
the QCCP may provide this number to
the clearing member.
• Step 2: The holding company compares
the hypothetical capital requirement (cal-
culated in Step 1) to the funded default
fund of the QCCP to include the inter-
nally funded resources of the QCCP. This
step determines the aggregate capital
requirement for all clearing members
assuming a default of two average clear-
ing members.
• Step 3: The aggregate capital require-
ment of all clearing members (assuming
the default of two members) is then
allocated back to the individual clearing
member ﬁrm and converted to a risk-
weighted asset amount.
Using the 3-step process and formulas pro-
vided in the regulatory capital rules, the
holding company will determine a dollar
capital requirement for its default fund
contribution for each QCCP (KCMi). The
holding company must then multiply each
KCMi by 1,250 percent to calculate the
risk-weighted asset amount. The holding
company must sum the RWAs calculated
for each QCCP default fund contribution to
produce a total RWA amount for all QCCP
default fund contributions for which the
holding company uses this method. For
example, the total RWA amount for a hold-
ing company with default fund contribu-
tions to two QCCPs will be the sum of
KCMi for QCCP A and KCMi for QCCP
B. This sum will be included in Component
B above for all QCCPs for which the
holding company uses method 1.
Method 2: Under Method 2, the risk
weighted assets for a clearing member’s
default fund contribution is the minimum
of:
• 1,250 percent times the holding com-
pany’s funded contributions to the QCCP
default fund, or,
• 18 percent times the total trade exposures
of the member to the QCCP.
A holding company will make this calcula-
tion for each QCCP for which it uses
Method 2. The sum of RWAs for all QCCP
contributions for which the holding com-
pany uses Method 2 will be included in
Component B above.
When a holding company SA-CCR to
determine the risk-weighted asset amount
of its default fund contributions, the regula-
tory capital rules provide that a clearing
member holding company ﬁrst calculates
the hypothetical capital requirement of the
QCCP (KCCP), unless the QCCP has
already disclosed it, in which case the
holding company must rely on that dis-
closed ﬁgure. In either case, a holding
company may choose to use a higher amount
of KCCP than the minimum calculated
under the formula or disclosed by the
QCCP if the holding company has con-
cerns about the nature, structure, or charac-
teristics of the QCCP.
For purposes of calculating KCCP, the PFE
multiplier includes collateral held by a
QCCP in which the QCCP has a legal claim
in the event of the default of the member or
client, including default fund contributions
of that member. In addition, the QCCP
must use a margin period of risk of 10 days
in the maturity factor. The component EADi
includes both the clearing member holding
company’s own transactions, the client
transactions guaranteed by the clearing
member, and all values of collateral held by
the QCCP (including the clearing member
holding company’s pre-funded default fund
contributions) against these transactions.
Notwithstanding §.133(d)(5) and (6)(ii) of
Schedule HC-R
FR Y-9C
HC-R-111
Schedule HC-R
March 2020

the regulatory capital rules, with the prior
approval of the regulator, a holding com-
pany may rely on a hypothetical capital
requirement of a QCCP based on a method-
ology other than SA-CCR for calculating
the exposure amount of a clearing member
of a QCCP to the QCCP.
A holding company that elects to use
SA-CCR is allowed to continue to use
method 1 or method 2 in under CEM to
calculate the risk-weighted asset amount
for default fund contributions until Janu-
ary 1, 2022.
• The portion of Schedule HC, items 6

On-balance sheet securitization exposures.
When determining the amount of risk-
weighted assets for securitization exposures,
holding companies that are not subject to the
market risk capital rule may elect to use either
the Simpliﬁed Supervisory Formula Approach
(SSFA)
or
the
Gross-Up
Approach,
as
described above and in §.41 to 45 of the
regulatory capital rules. However, such hold-
ing companies must use the SSFA or Gross-Up
Approach consistently across all securitiza-
tion exposures (Schedule HC-R, Part II, items
9(a) through 10). Holding companies may
risk weight any individual securitization expo-
sure at 1,250 percent in lieu of applying the
SSFA or Gross-Up Approach to that indi-
vidual exposure.
Holding companies subject to the market risk
capital rule must use the SSFA when deter-
mining the amount of risk-weighted assets for
securitization exposures.
For further information, refer to the discus-
sion of ‘‘Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitiza-
tion Exposures’’ in the General Instructions
for Schedule HC-R, Part II.

• In column U, report the risk-weighted asset
amount (not the exposure amount) of those
AFS securitization exposures for which the
risk-weighted asset amount is calculated
using the Gross-Up Approach, as described
above in the General Instructions for Sched-
ule HC-R, Part II, and in §.41 to §.45 of the
regulatory capital rules.
Example 1: A holding company reports an
AFS securitization exposure on its balance
sheet in Schedule HC, item 2(b), at a carrying
value (i.e., fair value) of $105. The amortized
cost of the AFS securitization exposure is
$100. The AFS securitization exposure has a
$5 unrealized gain that is included in AOCI.
The holding company would report has made
the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 3(a). The AFS securitization
exposure will be risk weighted using the
1,250 percent risk weight approach. The hold-
ing company would report in Schedule HC-R,
Part II, item 9(b):
• $105 in Column A. This is the carrying
value of the AFS securitization exposure
on the holding company’s balance sheet.
• $5 in Column B. This is the difference
between the carrying value (i.e., fair value)
of the AFS securitization exposure and its
exposure amount that is subject to risk-
weighting. For a holding company that has
made the AOCI opt-out election, column B
will typically represent the amount of unre-
alized gain or unrealized loss on a securiti-
zation exposure. Gains are reported as posi-
tive numbers; losses as negative numbers.
(Note: if the holding company has not
made or cannot make the AOCI opt-out
election, there will not be an adjustment to
be reported in column B.)
• $100 is the exposure amount subject to
risk-weighting.
This
amount
will
be
reported in item 9(b), column Q - 1,250
percent risk weight. For a holding com-
pany that has made the AOCI opt-out elec-
tion, the exposure amount typically will be
the carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the

AFS securitization exposure excluding any
unrealized gain or loss.
Example 2: A holding company reports an
AFS securitization exposure on its balance
sheet in Schedule HC, item 2(b), at a carrying
value (i.e., fair value) of $105. The AFS
securitization exposure has a $5 unrealized
gain that is included in AOCI. The holding
company has made the AOCI opt-out election
in Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a). The AFS
securitization exposure will be risk weighted
using the Gross-Up Approach and it is assigned
a 900 percent risk weight using this approach.
The holding company would report in Sched-
ule HC-R, Part II, item 9(b):
• $105 in Column A. This is the carrying
value of the AFS securitization exposure
on the holding company’s balance sheet.
• $105 in Column B. When the Gross-Up
Approach is being used, the carrying
amount of the AFS securitization exposure
on the holding company’s balance sheet is
to be reported in column B. Because the
holding company has made the AOCI opt-
out election, the $105 carrying amount
consists of two components: (i) $100 is the
exposure amount subject to risk-weighting
at 900 percent, and (ii) $5 is difference
between the carrying value and the expo-
sure amount that is subject to risk-
weighting.
• $900 reported in Column U. This is the
risk-weighted asset amount of the AFS
securitization exposure. This amount ($900)
will be reported in item 9(b), column U -
Gross-Up. (Note: $900 is the product of the
$100 exposure amount multiplied by a 900
percent risk weight.)
9(c)
Trading assets. Report in column A the fair
value of those trading assets reported in
Schedule HC, item 5, that qualify as securiti-
zation exposures as deﬁned in §.2 of the
regulatory capital rules. Refer to the instruc-
tions for Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 7, for a
summary of the reporting locations of trading
assets that are securitization exposures.
If the holding company is subject to the
market risk capital rule, report in column B
the fair value of those securitization expo-
sures reported in column A of this item that
are covered positions as deﬁned in Schedule
HC-R, Part II, item 27. The holding company
will report its standardized market risk-
weighted assets in Schedule HC-R, Part II,
item 27.
For holding companies not subject to the
market risk capital rule and for those trading
assets held by holding companies subject to
the market risk capital rule that are securitiza-
tion exposures that do not meet the deﬁnition
of a covered position:
• In column B, report the fair value reported
in column A of this item for those trading

SSFA or the Gross-Up Approach).
• In column T, report the risk-weighted asset
amount (not the fair value) of those trading

For other on-balance sheet securitization expo-
sures where the holding company cannot or
has not made the AOCI opt-out election (i.e.,
most AOCI is included in regulatory capital),
the exposure amount to be risk weighted by
the holding company is the exposure’s carry-

reported on the balance sheet of the holding
company determined in accordance with
GAAP and in column A.
Exposure amount to be used for purposes of

For other on-balance sheet securitization expo-
sures where the holding company has made
the AOCI opt-out election (i.e., most AOCI is
not included in regulatory capital), the expo-

Exposure amount to be used for purposes of
risk weighting
For an off-balance sheet securitization expo-
sure that is not a repo-style transaction or
eligible margin loan for which the holding
company calculates an exposure amount under
§.37 of the regulatory capital rules, cleared
transaction (other than a credit derivative), or
over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contract
(other than a credit derivative), the exposure
amount is the notional amount of the expo-
sure.
For an off-balance sheet securitization expo-
sure to an asset-backed commercial paper
(ABCP) program, such as an eligible ABCP
liquidity facility, the notional amount may be
reduced to the maximum potential amount
that holding company could be required to
fund given the ABCP program’s current under-
lying assets (calculated without regard to the
current credit quality of those assets).
The exposure amount of an eligible ABCP
liquidity facility for which the Simpliﬁed
Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA) does
not apply is equal to the notional amount of
the exposure multiplied by a credit conversion
factor (CCF) of 50 percent.
The exposure amount of an eligible ABCP
liquidity facility for which the SSFA applies
is equal to the notional amount of the expo-
sure multiplied by a CCF of 100 percent.
For an off-balance sheet securitization expo-
sure that is a repo-style transaction or eligible
margin loan for which the holding company
calculates an exposure amount under §.37 of
the regulatory capital rules, a cleared transac-
tion (other than a credit derivative), or deriva-
tive contract (other than a credit derivative),
the exposure amount is the amount calculated
under §.34, §.35, §.37, §.132, or §.133, as
applicable, of the regulatory capital rules.
For a credit-enhancing representation and
warranty that is an off-balance sheet securiti-
zation exposure, see the discussion of ‘‘Treat-

Treatment of Derivatives and Off-Balance Sheet Items
that are Securitization Exposures - Any derivatives or
off-balance sheet items reported in Schedule HC-L or
Schedule HC-S that qualify as securitization exposures,
including liquidity facilities to asset-back commercial
paper programs, are to be reported in Schedule HC-R,
Part II, item 10, column A, and excluded from Schedule
HC-R, Part II, items 12 through 21 below.
Repo-style transactions - The regulatory capital rules
permit some repo-style transactions to be risk weighted
on a netting set basis. Where netting is permitted, a
holding company will combine both on-balance and
off-balance sheet repo-style transactions in order to deter-
mine a capital requirement for a netting set to a single
counterparty. In such cases, a holding company should
combine securities purchased under agreements to resell
(i.e., reverse repos) and securities sold under agreements
to repurchase (i.e., repos) with off-balance sheet repo-
style transactions (i.e., securities borrowing and securi-
ties lending transactions) in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item
16, and report the netting set exposure to each counter-
party under the appropriate risk weight column.
Credit Conversion Factors for Off-Balance Sheet Items -
A summary of the credit conversion factors (CCFs) by
which the exposure amount of off-balance sheet items are
to be multiplied follows. For further information on these
factors, refer to the regulatory capital rules.

Retained recourse on small business obliga-

the amount of retained recourse on small
business obligations reported in Schedule
HC-S, Memorandum item 1(b), that do not
meet the deﬁnition of a securitization expo-

capital rules.
For retained recourse on small business obli-
gations sold with recourse that qualify as
securitization exposures, please see §42(h) of
the regulatory capital rule for purposes of
risk-weighting and report these exposures in
Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 10.
Under Section 208 of the Riegle Community
Development and Regulatory Improvement
Act of 1994, a ‘‘qualifying institution’’ that
transfers small business loans and leases on
personal property (small business obligations)
with recourse in a transaction that qualiﬁes as
a sale under generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) must maintain risk-based
capital only against the amount of recourse
retained, provided the institution establishes a
recourse liability account that is sufficient
under GAAP. Only loans and leases to busi-
nesses that meet the criteria for a small busi-
ness concern established by the Small Busi-
ness Administration under Section 3(c) of the
Small Business Act (12 U.S.C.631) are eli-
gible for this favorable risk-based capital
treatment.
In general, a ‘‘qualifying institution’’ is one
that is well capitalized without regard to the
Section 208 provisions. If a holding company
ceases to be a qualifying institution or exceeds
the retained recourse limit set forth in banking
agency regulations implementing Section 208,
all new transfers of small business obligations
with recourse would not be treated as sales.
However, the reporting and risk-based capital
treatment described above will continue to
apply to any transfers of small business obli-
gations with recourse that were consummated
during the time the holding company was a
‘‘qualifying institution’’ and did not exceed
the limit.

Report in column A the exposure amount of
repo-style transactions that do not meet the
deﬁnition of a securitization exposure as
described in §.2 of the regulatory capital
rules.
For repo-style transactions to which the hold-
ing company applies the Simple Approach to
recognize the risk-mitigating effects of quali-
fying ﬁnancial collateral, as outlined in §.37
of the regulatory capital rules, the exposure
amount to be reported in column A is the sum
of the fair value as of the report date of
securities the holding company has lent,40 the
amount of cash or the fair value as of the
report date of other collateral the holding
company has posted for securities borrowed,
the amount of cash provided to the counter-
party for securities purchased under agree-
ments to resell (as reported in Schedule HC,
item 3(b), and the fair value as of the report
date of securities sold under agreements to
repurchase.
For repo-style transactions to which the hold-
ing company applies the Collateral Haircut
Approach to recognize the risk-mitigating
effects of qualifying ﬁnancial collateral, as
outlined in §.37 of the regulatory capital rules,
the exposure amount to be reported in col-
umn A for a repo-style transaction or a single-
product netting set of such transactions is
determined by using the exposure amount
equation in §.37(c) of the regulatory capital
rules.
A holding company may apply either the
Simple Approach or the Collateral Haircut
Approach to repo-style transactions; however,
the holding company must use the same
approach for similar exposures or transac-
tions. For further information, see the discus-
sion of ‘‘Treatment of Collateral and Guaran-
tees’’ in the General Instructions for Schedule
HC-R, Part II.
• In column B, report 100 percent of the
exposure amount reported in column A.
• In column C-0% risk weight, include the
credit equivalent amount of repo-style trans-
actions that are supported by the appropri-
ate amount of collateral that qualiﬁes for
the zero percent risk weight under the
regulatory capital rules (refer to §.37 of the
regulatory capital rules).
• In column D-2% risk weight, include the
credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared
repo-style transactions with Qualiﬁed Cen-
tral Counterparties (QCCPs), as deﬁned in
§.2 and described in §.35 of the regulatory
capital rules.
• In column E-4% risk weight, include the
credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared
repo-style transactions with QCCPs in all
other cases that do not meet the criteria of
qualiﬁcation for a 2 percent risk weight, as
described in §.35 of the regulatory capital
rules.

chooses to recognize the risk-mitigating
effects of the securitization exposure collat-
eral under the simple approach or the collat-
eral haircut approach outlined in §.37 of the
regulatory capital rules. Under the simple
approach, the risk weight assigned to the
collateralized portion of the repo-style expo-

holding company must apply the same
approach for all repo-style transactions.
In addition, if the holding company
applies the simple approach, it must
apply the same approach - either the

Simple Approach for Recognizing Effects of
Schedule HC-R

Schedule HC-R
September 2015

Collateral
§.37 of the regulatory capital rules provides
for the recognition of the risk-mitigating
effects of collateral when risk-weighting assets
collateralized by ﬁnancial collateral, as deﬁned
in §.2. The following examples illustrate the
calculation of risk-weighted assets and the
reporting of securities sold under agreements
to repurchase (repos) in Schedule HC-R, Part
II, item 16, using the Simple Approach.
Example 1: Security sold under agreement
to repurchase fully collateralized by cash.
A holding company has transferred an
available-for-sale (AFS) debt security to a
counterparty in a repo transaction that is
accounted for as a secured borrowing on the
bank’s balance sheet. The bank received $100
in cash from the repo counterparty in this
transaction. The amortized cost and the fair
value of the AFS debt security are both $100
as of the report date.41 The debt security is an
exposure to a U.S. government sponsored
entity (GSE) that qualiﬁes for a 20 percent
risk weight. The repo counterparty is a com-
pany that would receive a 100 percent risk
weight.
Calculation of risk-weighted assets for the transaction:
1.
The holding company continues to report the AFS
GSE debt security as an asset on its balance sheet
and to risk weight the security as an on-balance sheet
asset at 20 percent:42
a.
$100 x 20% = $20
2.
The holding company has a $100 exposure to the
repo counterparty (the report date fair value of the
security transferred to the counterparty) that is collat-
eralized by the $100 of cash received from the
counterparty. The holding company risk weights its
exposure to the repo counterparty at zero percent in
recognition of the cash received in the transaction
from the counterparty: $100 x 0% = $0
3.
There is no additional exposure to the repo counter-
party to risk weight because the exposure to the
counterparty is fully collateralized by the cash
received.
Total risk-weighted assets arising from the
transactions: $20
The holding company would report the transaction as
follows:
1.
The holding company reports the AFS debt security
in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 2(b):
a.
The $100 carrying value (i.e., fair value) of the
AFS debt security on the balance sheet will be
reported in column A.43
b.
The $100 exposure amount of the AFS debt
security will be reported in column G - 20
percent risk weight (which is the applicable
risk weight for a U.S. GSE debt security).
2.
The holding company reports the repurchase agree-
ment in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 16:
a.
The holding company’s $100 exposure to the
repo counterparty, which is the fair value of
the debt security transferred in the repo trans-
action, is the exposure amount to be reported
in column A.
b.
The $100 credit equivalent amount of the
holding company’s exposure to the repo coun-
terparty will be reported in column B.
c.
Because the holding company’s exposure to
the repo counterparty is fully collateralized by
the $100 of cash received from the counter-
party, the $100 credit equivalent amount of the
repurchase agreement will be reported in col-
umn C - 0 percent risk weight (which is the
applicable risk weight for cash collateral).
41. In both Example 1 and Example 2, because the fair value carrying
value of the AFS GSE debt security equals the amortized cost of the debt
security, a holding company that has made the AOCI opt-out election in
Schedule HC-R, Part I, item 3(a), does not need to adjust the carrying
value (i.e., the fair value) of the debt security to determine the exposure
amount of the security. Thus, for a holding company that has made the
AOCI opt-out election, the carrying value of the AFS debt security equals
its exposure amount in Examples 1 and 2.

Example 2: Security sold under an agreement to
repurchase (repo) not fully collateralized by cash.
A holding company has transferred an AFS debt security
to a counterparty in a repo transaction that is accounted
for as a secured borrowing on the bank’s balance sheet.
The holding company received $98 in cash from the repo
counterparty in this transaction. The amortized cost and
the fair value of the AFS debt security are both $100 as of
the report date.44 The debt security is an exposure to a
U.S. GSE that qualiﬁes for a 20 percent risk weight. The
repo counterparty is a company that would receive a 100
percent risk weight.
Calculation of risk-weighted assets for the transaction:
1.
The bank continues to report the AFS GSE debt
security as an asset on its balance sheet and to
riskweight the security as an on-balance sheet asset
at 20 percent:45
$100 x 20% = $20
2.
The holding company has a $100 exposure to the
repo counterparty (the report date fair value of the
security transferred to the counterparty) of which
$98 is collateralized by the cash received from the
counterparty. The holding company risk weights the
portion of its exposure to the repo counterparty that
is collateralized by the cash received from the coun-
terparty at zero percent: $98 x 0% = $0
3.
The holding company risk weights its $2 uncollater-
alized exposure to the repo counterparty using the
risk weight applicable to the counterparty: $2 x
100% = $2
Total risk-weighted assets for the above
transactions: $22
The holding company would report the transaction in
Schedule HC-R, Part II, as follows:
1.
The holding reports the AFS debt security in item
2(b):
a. The $100 carrying value (i.e., the fair value) of
the AFS debt security on the balance sheet will be
reported in column A.46
b. The $100 exposure amount of the AFS debt
security will be reported in column G-20% risk
weight (which is the applicable risk weight for a
U.S. GSE debt security).
2.
The holding company reports the repurchase agree-
ment in item 16:
a. The holding company’s $100 exposure to the repo
counterparty, which is the fair value of the debt
security transferred in the repo transaction, is the
exposure amount to be reported in column A.
b. The $100 credit equivalent amount of the holding
company’s exposure to the repo counterparty will
be reported in column B.
c. Because the holding company’s exposure to the
repo counterparty is collateralized by the $98 of
cash received from the counterparty, $98 of the

All other off-balance sheet liabilities. Report
in column A:
• The notional amount of all other off-balance
sheet liabilities reported in Schedule HC-L,
item 9, that are covered by the regulatory
capital rules,
• The face amount of risk participations in
bankers acceptances that have been acquired
by the reporting institution and are out-
standing,
• The full amount of loans sold with credit-
enhancing representations and warranties47
that do not meet the deﬁnition of a securiti-
zation exposure as described in §.2 of the
regulatory capital rules,
• The notional amount of written option con-
tracts that act as ﬁnancial guarantees that do
not meet the deﬁnition of a securitization
exposure as described in §.2 of the regula-
tory capital rules, and
• The notional amount of all forward agree-
ments, which are deﬁned as legally binding
contractual obligations to purchase assets
with certain drawdown at a speciﬁed future
date, not including commitments to make
residential mortgage loans or forward for-
eign exchange contracts.
However, exclude from column A:
• The amount of credit derivatives classiﬁed
as trading assets that are subject to the
market risk capital rule (report in Schedule
HC-R, Part II, items 20 and 21, as appropri-
ate), and
• Credit derivatives purchased by the holding
company that are recognized as guarantees
of an asset or off-balance sheet exposure
under the regulatory capital rules, i.e., credit
derivatives on which the holding company
is the beneﬁciary (report the guaranteed
asset or exposure in Schedule HC-R, Part II,
47. The deﬁnition of credit-enhancing representations and warranties in
§.2 of the regulatory capital rules states that such representations and
warranties obligate a holding company “to protect another party from
losses arising from the credit risk of the underlying exposures” and
“include provisions to protect a party from losses resulting from the default
or nonperformance of the counterparties of the underlying exposures or
from an insufficiency in the value of the collateral backing the underlying
exposures.” Thus, when loans or other assets are sold “with recourse” and
the recourse arrangement provides protection from losses as described in
the preceding deﬁnition, the recourse arrangement constitutes a credit-
enhancing representation and warranty.

sure or mutual fund collateral that collat-
eralizes the portion of unused commit-
ments secured by such collateral. Any

Original maturity exceeding one year.
Report in column A the unused portion of
those commitments to make or purchase exten-
sions of credit in the form of loans or partici-
pations in loans, lease ﬁnancing receivables,
or similar transactions reported in Schedule
HC-L, item 1, that have an original maturity
exceeding one year and are subject to the
regulatory capital rules. Also report in column
A the face amount of those commercial and
similar letters of credit reported in Schedule
HC-L, item 4, with an original maturity
exceeding one year that do not meet the
deﬁnition of a securitization exposure as
described in §.2 of the regulatory capital
rules.
Under the regulatory capital rules, the unused
portion of commitments (facilities) which are
unconditionally cancelable (without cause) at
any time by the holding company (to the
extent permitted under applicable law) have a
zero percent credit conversion factor. The
unused portion of such unconditionally can-
celable commitments should be excluded from
this item and reported in Schedule HC-R, Part
II, item 19. For further information, see the
instructions for item 19.
Also include in column A the unused portion
all revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs)
and note issuance facilities (NIFs), regardless
of maturity.
In the case of consumer home equity or
mortgage lines of credit secured by liens on
1-4 family residential properties, a holding
company is deemed able to unconditionally
cancel the commitment if, at its option, it can

short-term commitments that should be con-
verted at zero percent and excluded from this
item 18(b) if the holding company has the
unconditional right to cancel the line of credit
at any time in accordance with applicable law.
For commitments providing for increases in
the dollar amount of the commitment, the
amount to be converted to an on-balance sheet
credit equivalent amount and risk weighted is
the maximum dollar amount that the holding
company is obligated to advance at any time
during the life of the commitment. This
includes seasonal commitments where the
dollar amount of the commitment increases
during the customer’s peak business period.
In addition, this risk-based capital treatment
applies to long-term commitments that con-
tain short-term options which, for a fee, allow
the customer to increase the dollar amount of
the commitment. Until the short-term option
has expired, the reporting holding company
must convert and risk weight the amount
which it is obligated to lend if the option is
exercised. After the expiration of a short-term
option which has not been exercised, the
unused portion of the original amount of the
commitment is to be used in the credit conver-
sion process.
• In column B, report 50 percent of the
amount of unused commitments and the
face amount of commercial and similar
letters of credit reported in column A. Note
that unused commitments that qualify as
securitization exposures as deﬁned in §.2 of
the regulatory capital rules should be
reported as securitization exposures in
Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 10.
• In column C-0% risk weight, include the
credit equivalent amount of unused commit-
ments and commercial and similar letters of
credit to counterparties who meet, or that

Unconditionally cancelable commitments.
Report the unused portion of those uncondi-

Schedule HC-L, item 1, that are subject to the
regulatory capital rules. The unused portion
of commitments (facilities) that are uncondi-
tionally cancelable (without cause) at any
time by the bank (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) have a zero percent credit
conversion factor. The holding company
should report the unused portion of such
commitments in column A of this item and
zero in column B of this item.
In the case of consumer home equity or
mortgage lines of credit secured by liens on
1-4 family residential properties, a holding
company is deemed able to unconditionally
cancel the commitment if, at its option, it can

Over-the-counter derivatives. Report in col-
umn B the credit equivalent amount of over-
the-counter derivative contracts covered by
the regulatory capital rules. As deﬁned in §.2
of the regulatory capital rules, an over-the-
counter (OTC) derivative contract is a deriva-
tive contract that is not a cleared transaction.48
Include OTC credit derivative contracts held
for trading purposes and subject to the market
risk capital rule. Include the client-facing leg
of a derivative contract cleared through a
central counterparty or a qualiﬁed central
counterparty, which is to be reported as an
over-the-counter derivative. Otherwise, do not
include the credit equivalent amount of cen-
trally cleared derivative contracts, which must
be reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 21.
Do not include OTC derivative contracts that
meet the deﬁnition of a securitization expo-
sure as described in §.2 of the regulatory
capital rules; such derivative contracts must
be reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 10.
The credit equivalent amount of a noncleared
derivative contract to be reported in column B
is determined under one of two methods, the
Current
Exposure
Method
(CEM),
as
described in 12 CFR 217.34(b) of the regula-
tory capital rule, or the Standardized Approach
for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR), as
described in 12 CFR 217.132(c) of the regu-
latory capital rule. Under the regulatory capi-
tal rule, a nonadvanced approaches holding
company may elect to use CEM or SA-CCR
to determine the credit equivalent amount of a
noncleared derivative contract, as of April 1,
2020 (and as of January 1, 2020, at a holding
company’s option on a best efforts basis). A
non-advanced approaches holding company
must notify the Board before using SA-CCR.
A non-advanced approaches holding com-
pany must use the same methodology to cal-
culate the exposure amount for all its deriva-
tive contracts, including centrally cleared
derivative transactions, and may change its
election only with the prior approval of the
Board. As of January 1, 2022, an advanced
approaches
holding
company
must
use
SA-CCR to determine the credit equivalent
amount of a derivative contract for purposes
of standardized approach total risk-weighted
assets and the supplementary leverage ratio.
However, such a holding company may elect
to use SA-CCR as of April 1, 2020, by
notifying the Board (and as of January 1,
2020, at a holding company’s option on a best
efforts basis).
48. An OTC derivative includes a transaction:
(1) Between an institution that is a clearing member and a counter-
party where the institution is acting as a ﬁnancial intermediary
and enters into a cleared transaction with a central counterparty
(CCP) that offsets the transaction with the counterparty; or
(2) In which an institution that is a clearing member provides a CCP
a guarantee on the performance of the counterparty to the transac-
tion.

When using the CEM, the credit equivalent
amount of an OTC derivative contract to be
reported in Column B is the sum of its current
credit exposure (as reported in Schedule HC-R,
Part II, Memorandum item 1) plus the poten-
tial future exposure (PFE) over the remaining
life of the derivative contract (regardless of its
current credit exposure, if any), as described
in §.34 of the regulatory capital rules. The
current credit exposure of a derivative con-
tract is (1) the fair value of the contract when
that fair value is positive and (2) zero when
the fair value of the contract is negative or
zero. The PFE exposure of a contract, which
is based on the type of contract and the
contract’s remaining maturity, is determined
by multiplying the notional principal amount
of the contract by the appropriate credit con-
version factor from the following chart. The
notional principal amounts of the reporting
holding company’s OTC derivatives that are
subject to the risk-based capital requirements
are reported by remaining maturity in Sched-
ule HC-R, Part II, Memorandum items 2(a)
through 2(g).

Under the Board’s regulatory capital rules and for pur-
poses of Schedule HC-R, Part II, the existence of a
legally enforceable bilateral netting agreement between
the reporting holding company and a counterparty may
be taken into consideration when determining both the
current credit exposure and the potential future exposure
of derivative contracts. For further information on the
treatment of bilateral netting agreements covering deriva-
tive contracts, refer to the instructions for Schedule
HC-R, Part II, Memorandum item 1, and §.34 of the
regulatory capital rules.
When assigning OTC derivative exposures to risk weight
categories, holding companies can recognize the risk-
mitigating effects of ﬁnancial collateral by using either
the simple approach or the collateral haircut approach, as
described in §.37 of the regulatory capital rules.
When using SA-CCR, the credit equivalent amount of an
OTC derivative contract to be reported in column B is the
sum of its current credit exposure (as reported in Sched-
ule HC-R, Part II, Memorandum item 1) plus the poten-
tial future exposure over the remaining life of the deriva-
tive contract (regardless of its current credit exposure, if
any), as described in §.132 of the regulatory capital rule.
When using SA-CCR, a holding company should use the
value of the replacement cost amount for its current
credit exposure.
Under SA-CCR, the determination of the replacement
cost depends on whether the counterparty to a holding
company is required to post variation margin pursuant to
a variation margin agreement. The replacement cost for a
netting set that is not subject to a variation margin
agreement is equal to the greater of (1) the sum of the fair
values (after excluding any valuation adjustments) of the
derivative contracts within the netting set, less the net
independent collateral amount applicable to such deriva-
tive contracts, or (2) zero. For a netting set that is subject
to a variation margin agreement where the counterparty
is required to post variation margin, replacement cost is
equal to the greater of (1) the sum of the fair values (after
excluding any valuation adjustments) of the derivative
contracts within the netting set, less the sum of the net
independent collateral amount and the variation margin
amount applicable to such derivative contracts; (2) the
sum of the variation margin threshold and the minimum
transfer amount applicable to the derivative contracts
within the netting set, less the net independent collateral
amount applicable to such derivative contracts; or (3)
zero. PFE under SA-CCR is equal to the product of the
PFE multiplier and the aggregated amount. To determine
the aggregated amount, a holding company is required to
determine the hedging set amounts for the derivative
contracts within a netting set, where a hedging set is
comprised of derivative contracts that share similar risk
factors based on asset class (e.g., interest rate, exchange
rate, credit, equity, and commodity).
• In column C-0% risk weight, include the
credit equivalent amount of over-the-

Centrally cleared derivatives. Report in col-
umn B the credit equivalent amount of cen-
trally cleared derivative contracts covered by
the regulatory capital rules. As described in
§.2 of the regulatory capital rules, a centrally
cleared derivative contract is an exposure
associated with an outstanding derivative con-
tract that an institution, or an institution that is
a clearing member has entered into with a
central counterparty (CCP), that is, a transac-
tion that a CCP has accepted. Include cen-
trally cleared credit derivative contracts held
for trading purposes that are subject to the
market risk capital rule and meet the opera-
tional requirements for counterparty credit
risk in §.3 of the regulatory capital rules.
However, do not include the client-facing leg
of a derivative contract cleared through a CCP
or a qualiﬁed CCP, which is to be reported as
an over-thecounter derivative in Sched-
ule HC-R, Part II, item 20. For information on
the regulatory capital treatment of settled-to-
market contracts, see the discussion of “Treat-
ment of Certain Centrally Cleared Derivative
Contracts” in the General Instructions for
Schedule HC-R, Part II. Do not include cen-
trally cleared derivative contracts that meet
the deﬁnition of a securitization exposure as
described in §.2 of the regulatory capital
rules; such derivative contracts must be
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 10.
The credit equivalent amount of a centrally
cleared derivative contract to be reported in
column B is determined under either §.35 or
§.133 of the regulatory capital rules. Under
the regulatory capital rule, a non-advanced
approaches holding company that elects to
calculate the exposure amount for its OTC
derivative contracts using the Standardized
Approach— Counterparty Credit Risk Method
(SA-CCR), as described in §.132(c), must
apply the treatment of cleared transactions
under §.133 to its derivative contracts that are
cleared transactions and to all default fund
contributions associated with such derivative
contracts, rather than applying §.35.
A non-advanced approaches holding com-
pany must use the same methodology to cal-
culate the exposure amount for all its deriva-
tive contracts and may change its election
only with the prior approval of the Board. An
advanced approaches holding company must
apply the treatment of cleared transactions
under §.133 of the regulatory capital rules to
its derivative contracts that are cleared trans-
actions and to all default fund contributions
associated with such derivative contracts.
When using the Current Exposure Method
(CEM), the credit equivalent amount of a
centrally cleared derivative contract is the
sum of its current credit exposure (as reported
in Schedule HC-R, Part II, Memorandum
item 1), plus the potential future exposure
(PFE) over the remaining life of the derivative
contract, plus the fair value of collateral
posted by the clearing member client and held
by the CCP or a clearing member in a manner
that is not bankruptcy remote. The current
credit exposure of a derivative contract is (1)
the fair value of the contract when that fair
value is positive and (2) zero when the fair
value of the contract is negative or zero. The
potential future credit exposure of a contract,
which is based on the type of contract and the
contract’s remaining maturity, is determined
by multiplying the notional principal amount
of the contract by the appropriate credit con-
version factor from the following chart. The
notional principal amounts of the reporting
holding company’s centrally cleared deriva-
tives that are subject to the risk-based capital

When using SA-CCR, the credit equivalent
amount of a centrally cleared derivative con-
tract equals an alpha factor of 1.4 multiplied
by the the sum of its current credit exposure
(as reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, Memo-
randum item 1), plus the PFE over the remain-
ing life of the derivative contract, plus the fair
value of collateral posted by the clearing
member client bank and held by the CCP or a
clearing member in a manner that is not
bankruptcy remote. When using SA-CCR, a
holding company should use the value of the
replacement cost amount for its current credit
exposure.
Under SA-CCR, the determination of the
replacement cost depends on whether the
counterparty to a holding company is required
to post variation margin. The replacement
cost for a netting set that is not subject to a
variation margin agreement is equal to the
greater of (1) the sum of the fair values (after
excluding any valuation adjustments) of the
derivative contracts within the netting set, less
the net independent collateral amount applica-
ble to such derivative contracts, or (2) zero.
For a netting set that is subject to a variation
margin agreement where the counterparty is
required to post variation margin, replacement
cost is equal to the greater of (1) the sum of
the fair values (after excluding any valuation
adjustments) of the derivative contracts within
the netting set, less the sum of the net indepen-
dent collateral amount and the variation mar-
gin amount applicable to such derivative con-
tracts; (2) the sum of the variation margin
threshold and the minimum transfer amount
applicable to the derivative contracts within
the netting set, less the net independent collat-
eral amount applicable to such derivative con-
tracts; or (3) zero. PFE under SA-CCR is
equal to the product of the PFE multiplier and
the aggregated amount. To determine the
aggregated amount, a bank is required to
determine the hedging set amounts for the
derivative contracts within a netting set, where
a hedging set is comprised of derivative con-
tracts that share similar risk factors based on
asset class (e.g., interest rate, exchange rate,
credit, equity, and commodity).
When using the SA-CCR method, a holding
company may elect to treat settled-to-market
derivative contracts as subject to a variation
margin agreement and receive the beneﬁts of
netting with collateralized-to-market deriva-
tive contracts. If a holding company elects to
treat settled-to-market derivative contracts as
subject to a variation margin agreement, it
must apply the maturity factor to such con-
tracts under 12 CFR 217.132(c)(9)(iv)(A) of
the regulatory capital rules. The maturity fac-
tor of a derivative contract that is subject to a
variation margin agreement, excluding deriva-
tive contracts that are subject to a variation

margin agreement under which the counter-
party is not required to post variation margin,
is determined by the following formula:
where MPOR refers to the period from the
most recent exchange of collateral under a
variation margin agreement with a defaulting
counterparty until the derivative contracts are
closed out and the resulting market risk is
re-hedged.
• In column C-0% risk weight, include the
credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared
derivative contracts with CCPs and other
counterparties who meet, or that have guar-
antees or collateral that meet the criteria for
the zero percent risk weight category as
described in the instructions for Risk-
Weighted Assets and for Schedule HC-R,
Part II, items 1 through 8, above.
• In column D-2% risk weight, include the
credit equivalent amount of centrally cleared
derivative contracts with Qualiﬁed Central
Counterparties (QCCPs) where the collat-

arrangement that prevents any losses to the
clearing member client due to the joint
default or a concurrent insolvency, liquida-
tion, or receivership proceeding of the clear-
ing member and any other clearing member
clients of the clearing member; and the

Unsettled transactions (failed trades).
Note: This item includes unsettled transac-
tions in the reporting holding company’s
trading book and in its banking book. Report
as unsettled transactions all on- and off-
balance sheet transactions involving securi-
ties, foreign exchange instruments, and com-
modities that have a risk of delayed
settlement or delivery, or are already
delayed, and against which the reporting
holding company must hold risk-based capi-
tal as described in §.38 of the regulatory
capital rules.
For delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transac-
tions49 and payment-versus-payment (PvP)
transactions,50 report in column A the posi-
tive current exposure of those unsettled
transactions with a normal settlement period
in which the reporting holding company’s
counterparty has not made delivery or pay-
ment within ﬁve business days after the
settlement date, which are the DvP and PvP
transactions subject to risk weighting under
§.38 of the regulatory capital rules. Positive
current exposure is equal to the difference
between the transaction value at the agreed
settlement price and the current market price
of the transaction, if the difference results in
a credit exposure of the holding company to
the counterparty.
For delayed non-DvP/non-PVP transac-
tions,51 also include in column A the current
fair value of the deliverables owed to the
holding company by the counterparty in
those transactions with a normal settlement
period in which the reporting holding com-
pany has delivered cash, securities, com-
modities, or currencies to its counterparty,
but has not received its corresponding deliv-
erables, which are the non-DvP/non-PvP
transactions subject to risk weighting under
§.38 of the regulatory capital rules.
Do not include in this item: (1) cleared
transactions that are marked-to-market daily
and subject to daily receipt and payment of
variation margin; (2) repo-style transac-
tions, including unsettled repo-style transac-
tions; (3) one-way cash payments on over-
the-counter derivatives; and (4) transactions
with a contractual settlement period that is
longer than the normal settlement period
(generally greater than 5 business days).
• In column C-0% risk weight, include the
fair value of deliverables owed to the hold-
ing company by a counterparty that quali-
ﬁes for a zero percent risk weight under
§.32 of the regulatory capital rules that have
been delayed one to four business days for
non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.
• In column G-20% risk weight, include the
fair value of deliverables owed to the hold-
ing company by a counterparty that quali-
ﬁes for a 20 percent risk weight under §.32
of the regulatory capital rules that have

ﬁes for a 50 percent risk weight under §.32
of the regulatory capital rules that have
been delayed one to four business days for
non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.
• In column I-100% risk weight, include:
o The fair value of deliverables owed to the
holding company by a counterparty that
qualiﬁes for a 100 percent risk weight

Standardized market risk-weighted assets.
Report the amount of the holding company’s
standardized market risk-weighted assets. This
line item is applicable only to those holding
companies covered by Subpart F of the regulatory
capital rules (i.e., the market risk capital rule), as
provided in §.201 of the regulatory capital rules.
A holding company’s measure for market risk for
its covered positions is the sum of its value-at-
risk (VaR)-based, stressed VaR-based, incremen-
tal risk, and comprehensive risk capital require-
ments plus its speciﬁc risk add-ons and any
capital requirement for de minimis exposures. A
holding company’s market risk-weighted assets
equal its measure for market risk multiplied by
12.5 (the reciprocal of the minimum 8.0 percent
capital ratio).
A covered position is a trading asset or trading
liability (whether on- or off-balance sheet), as
reported on Schedule HC-D, that is held for any
of the following reasons:
(1) For the purpose of short-term resale;
(2) With the intent of beneﬁting from actual or
expected short-term price movements;
(3) To lock in arbitrage proﬁts; or
(4) To hedge another covered position.
Additionally, the trading asset or trading liability
must be free of any restrictive covenants on its
tradability or the holding company must be able
to hedge the material risk elements of the trading
asset or trading liability in a two-way market. A
covered position also includes a foreign exchange
or commodity position, regardless of whether the
position is a trading asset or trading liability
(excluding structural foreign currency positions if
supervisory approval has been granted to exclude
such positions).
A covered position does not include:
(1) An intangible asset (including any servicing
asset);
(2) A hedge of a trading position that is outside
the scope of the holding company’s hedging
strategy;
(3) Any position that, in form or substance, acts
as a liquidity facility that provides support to
asset-backed commercial paper;
(4) A credit derivative recognized as a guarantee
for risk-weighted asset calculation purposes under
the regulatory capital rules for credit risk;
(5) An equity position that is not publicly traded
(other than a derivative that references a publicly
traded equity);
(6) A position held with the intent to securitize;
or
(7) A direct real estate holding.

Risk-weighted assets before deductions for
excess AACL and allocated transfer risk
reserve. Report the sum of items 2(b) through 20,
column S; items 9(a), 9(b), 9(c), 9(d), and 10,
columns T and U; item 25, columns C through Q;
and, if applicable, item 27. (Item 27 is applicable
only to holding companies that are subject to the

LESS: Excess AACL. Report the amount, if any,
by which the holding company’s AACL for regu-
latory reporting purposes exceeds 1.25 percent of
the holding company’s risk-weighted assets base
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 26.
A holding company’s AACL for regulatory capi-
tal purposes equals Schedule H, Part II, item 7,
columns A and B, “Balance end of current
period” for loans and leases held for investment
and held-to-maturity debt securities, respectively;
plus Schedule HI-B, Part II, Memorandum item

exposure amount when using the Current
Exposure Method (CEM) or replacement cost
amount
when
using
the
Standardized
Approach - Counterparty Credit Risk Method
(SA-CCR) after considering qualiﬁed master
netting agreement, as deﬁned under the capi-
tal rule derivative contracts that are over-the-
counter derivative contracts (as deﬁned in §.2
of the regulatory capital rules) and all deriva-
tive contracts that are cleared transactions (as
described in §.2 of the regulatory capital
rules) and are covered by §.34, §.35, §.132,
and §.133 of the regulatory capital rules, as
applicable. Holding companies that are sub-
ject to the market risk capital rule should
exclude all covered positions subject to that
rule, except for foreign exchange derivatives
that are outside of the trading account. For-
eign exchange derivatives that are outside of
the trading account and all over-the-counter
derivatives continue to have a counterparty
credit risk capital charge and, therefore, a
current credit exposure amount for these
derivatives should be reported in this item.
Include the current credit exposure arising
from credit derivative contracts where the
holding company is the protection purchaser
(beneﬁciary) and the credit derivative con-
tract is either (a) deﬁned as a covered posi-
tion under the market risk capital rule or (b)
not deﬁned as a covered position under the
market risk capital rule and is not recognized
as a guarantee for regulatory capital pur-
poses.
As discussed further below, current credit
exposure (sometimes referred to as the
replacement cost) is the fair value of a deriva-
tive contract when that fair value is positive.
The current credit exposure is zero when the
fair value is negative or zero.
Exclude the positive fair value of derivative
contracts that are neither over-the-counter
derivative contracts nor derivative contracts
that are cleared transactions under §.2 of the
regulatory capital rules. Such derivative con-
tracts include written option contracts, includ-
ing so-called “derivative loan commitments,”
i.e., a lender’s commitment to originate a
mortgage loan that will be held for resale.
Written option contracts that are, in sub-
stance, ﬁnancial guarantees, are discussed
below. For “derivative loan commitments,”
which are reported as over-the-counter writ-
ten option contracts in Schedule HC-L, if the
fair value of such a commitment is positive
and reported as an asset in Schedule HC,
item 11, this positive fair value should be
reported in the appropriate risk-weight cate-
gory in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 8, and
not as a component of the current credit
exposure to be reported in this item.
Purchased options held by the reporting hold-
ing company that are traded on an exchange
are covered by the regulatory capital rules
unless such options are subject to a daily
variation margin. Variation margin is deﬁned
as the gain or loss on open positions, calcu-
lated by marking to market at the end of each
trading day. Such gain or loss is credited or
Schedule HC-R
HC-R-142
FR Y-9C
Schedule HC-R
March 2024

debited by the clearing house to each clearing
member’s account, and by members to their
customers’ accounts.
If a written option contract acts as a ﬁnancial
guarantee that does not meet the deﬁnition of
a securitization exposure as described in §.2
of the regulatory capital rules, then for risk-
based capital purposes the notional amount
of the option should be included in Schedule
HC-R, Part II, item 17, column A, as part of
‘‘All other off-balance sheet liabilities.’’ An
example of such a contract occurs when the
reporting holding company writes a put option
to a second holding company or a bank that
has a loan to a third party. The strike price
would be the equivalent of the par value of
the loan. If the credit quality of the loan
deteriorates, thereby reducing the value of
the loan to the second holding company or
bank, the reporting holding company would
be required by the second holding company
or bank to take the loan onto its books.
Do not include derivative contracts that meet
the deﬁnition of a securitization exposure as
described in §.2 of the regulatory capital
rules; such derivative contracts must be
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 10.
Current credit exposure, when using CEM, or
replacement cost, when using SA-CCR,
should be derived as follows: Determine
whether a qualifying master netting agree-
ment, as deﬁned in §.2 of the regulatory
capital rules, is in place between the report-
ing holding company and a counterparty. If
such an agreement is in place, the fair values
of all applicable derivative contracts with
that counterparty that are included in the
netting agreement are netted to a single
amount.
Next, for all other contracts covered by the
regulatory capital rules that have positive fair
values, the total of the positive fair values is
determined. Then, report in this item the sum
of (i) the net positive fair values of applicable
derivative contracts subject to qualifying
master netting agreements and (ii) the total
positive fair values of all other contracts
covered by the regulatory capital rules for
both over-the-counter and centrally cleared
contracts.
The
current
credit
exposure
reported in this item is a component of the
credit equivalent amount of derivative con-
tracts that is to be reported in Schedule
HC-R, items 20 or 21, column B, depending
on whether the contracts are centrally cleared.
M2
Notional principal amounts of over-the-
counter derivative contracts. Report in the
appropriate subitem and column the notional
amount or par value of all over-the-counter
derivative contracts, including credit deriva-
tives, that are subject to §.34 or §.132 of the
regulatory capital rules.52 Such contracts
include swaps, forwards, and purchased
options. Do not include over-the-counter
derivative contracts that meet the deﬁnition
of a securitization exposure as described in
§.2 of the regulatory capital rules; such
derivative contracts must be reported in
Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 10. Report
notional amounts and par values in the col-
umn corresponding to the OTC derivative
contract’s remaining term to maturity from
the report date. Remaining maturities are to
be reported as (1) one year or less in column
A, (2) over one year through ﬁve years in
column B, or (3) over ﬁve years in column C.
Regardless of whether a holding company
uses the standardized approach for counter-
party credit risk (SA-CCR) or the current
exposure methodology (CEM) to calculate
exposure amounts for its derivative contracts,
report in Schedule HC-R, Part II, memoran-
dum items 2.a through 2.g, the notional
amounts of the contracts, as this term is
deﬁned in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, unless a derivative contract has a

CEM is the contract’s effective notional
amount or par value. (For example, a swap
contract with a stated notional amount of
$1,000,000 whose terms call for quarterly
settlement of the difference between 5 per-
cent and LIBOR multiplied by 10 has an
effective notional amount of $10,000,000.)
The notional amount to be reported for an
amortizing OTC derivative contract under
SA-CCR and CEM is the contract’s current
(or, if appropriate, effective) notional amount.
This notional amount should be reported in
the column corresponding to the contract’s
remaining term to ﬁnal maturity.
For descriptions of “interest rate contracts,”
“foreign exchange contracts,” “commodity
and other contracts,” and “equity derivative
contracts,” refer to the instructions for Sched-
ule HC-L, item 12. For a description of
“credit derivative contracts,” refer to the
instructions for Schedule HC-L, item 7.
Exclude from this item the notational amount
of OTC written contracts, including so-called
“derivative loan commitments,” which are
not subject to §.34 of the regulatory capital
rules.
When using SA-CCR, include gold in the
precious metals category for Schedule HC-R,
Part II, Memorandum items 2.f and 3.f and
exclude gold from the foreign exchange rate
category for Schedule HC-R, Part II, Memo-
randum items 2.b and 3.b.
When using SA-CCR, a holding company
may elect to treat a credit or equity derivative
contract that references an index as if it were
multiple derivative contracts each referenc-
ing one component of the index. Thus, under
this election, a holding company would apply
the SA-CCR methodology to each decom-
posed component of the index instead of
applying the SA-CCR methodology to the
index derivative contract. A holding com-
pany must allocate the notional amount in the
same category that it elected for purposes of
applying the regulatory capital rules.
When using SA-CCR, a holding company
may elect to treat a commodity derivative
contract that references an index as if it were

poses of applying the regulatory capital rules.

principal) in the derivative contract.

Notional principal amounts of centrally
cleared derivative contracts. Report in the
appropriate subitem and column the notional
amount or par value of all derivative con-
tracts, including credit derivatives, that are
cleared transactions (as described in §.2 of
the regulatory capital rules) and are subject to
§.35 of the regulatory capital rules.53 Such
centrally cleared derivative contracts include
swaps, forwards, and purchased options. Do
not include centrally cleared derivative con-
tracts that meet the deﬁnition of a securitiza-
tion exposure as described in §.2 or §1.33 of
the regulatory capital rules; such derivative
contracts must be reported in Schedule HC-R,
Part II, item 10. Report notional amounts and
par values in the column corresponding to the
centrally cleared derivative contract’s remain-
ing term to maturity from the report date.
Remaining maturities are to be reported as
(1) one year or less in column A, (2) over one
year through ﬁve years in column B, or (3)
over ﬁve years in column C.
Regardless of whether a holding company
uses the standardized approach for counter-
party credit risk (SA-CCR) or the current
exposure methodology (CEM) to calculate
exposure amounts for its derivative contracts,
report in Schedule HCR, Part II, Memoran-
dum items 3.a through 3.g, the notional
amounts of the contracts, as this term is
deﬁned in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, unless a derivative contract has a
multiplier component as discussed in the
following paragraph.
The notional amount or par value to be
reported under SA-CCR and CEM for a
centrally cleared derivative contract with a
multiplier component is the contract’s effec-
tive notional amount or par value. (For exam-
ple, a swap contract with a stated notional
amount of $1,000,000 whose terms call for
quarterly settlement of the difference between
5 percent and LIBOR multiplied by 10 has an
effective notional amount of $10,000,000.)
The notional amount to be reported under
SA-CCR and CEM for an amortizing deriva-
tive contract is the contract’s current (or, if
appropriate, effective) notional amount. This
notional amount should be reported in the
column corresponding to the contract’s
remaining term to ﬁnal maturity.
For purposes of reporting remaining maturi-
ties in Schedule HC-R, Part II, memorandum
3.a through 3.g, settled-to-market cleared
derivatives should be treated in the following
manner: When a holding company uses CEM
for risk-based capital purposes, if a cleared
derivative contract meets the settled-to-
market cleared derivative criteria in the bank-
ing agencies’ August 2017 supervisory guid-
ance on the regulatory capital treatment of
certain centrally cleared derivative con-
tracts,54 the remaining maturity equals the
time until the next exchange of variation
margin on the contract.
When a holding company uses SA-CCR, if a
cleared derivative contract meets the settled-
to-market cleared derivative criteria in the
banking agencies’ August 2017 supervisory
guidance on the regulatory capital treatment
of certain centrally cleared derivative con-
tracts,55 the remaining maturity equals the
time until the next exchange of variation
margin on the contract.
53. See the instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 21, for the
description of a centrally cleared derivative contract.

However, if the holding company elects to
treat such a settled-to-market cleared deriva-
tive as a collateralized-to-market cleared
derivative, the remaining maturity of the
derivative should be determined as E – S,
where E is the number of business days from
the present day (i.e., the report date) until the
end date of the derivative contract and S is
the number of business days from the present

When using SA-CCR, a holding company
may elect to treat a credit or equity derivative
contract that references an index as if it were
multiple derivative contracts each referenc-
ing one component of the index. Thus, under
this election, a holding company would apply
the SA-CCR methodology to each decom-
posed component of the index instead of
applying the SACCR methodology to the
index derivative contract. A holding com-
pany must allocate the notional amount in the
same category that it elected for purposes of
applying the regulatory capital rules.

speciﬁc risk, included in Schedule HC-R,
Part II, item 26, “Standardized measurement
of market risk-weighted assets (applicable to
all holding companies that are covered by the
Market Risk Rule).” Speciﬁc risk refers to
changes in the market value of speciﬁc posi-
tions due to factors other than broad market
movements and includes event and default
risk. For further background information, hold-

Amount of allowances for credit losses on
purchased credit-deteriorated assets: “Pur-
chased credit-deteriorated assets” are acquired
individual ﬁnancial assets (or acquired groups
of ﬁnancial assets with similar risk character-

Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit
Losses, that, as of the date of acquisition, have
experienced a more-than-insigniﬁcant deterio-
ration in credit quality since origination, as
determined by the acquiring institution’s
assessment.
Holding companies are required to estimate
and record a credit loss allowance for a PCD
asset at the time of purchase. The credit loss
allowance is then added to the purchase price
to determine the amortized cost basis of the
asset for ﬁnancial reporting purposes. Post-
acquisition increases in credit loss allowances
on PCD assets will be established through a
charge to earnings.

for credit-enhancing interest-only strips (which are
reported in item 2 of this schedule), subordinated securi-
ties and other enhancements (which are reported in
items 2 and 9, and Memorandum items 3(a)(1) and
(2)), and seller’s interests (which are reported in item 6).

For purposes of items 1 through 10 of Schedule HC-S on
bank securitization activities and other securitization
facilities, information about each separate securitization
should be included in only one of the columns of this
schedule. The appropriate column for a particular securi-
tization should be based on the predominant type of loan,
lease, or other asset included in the securitization and this
column should be used consistently over time. For exam-
ple, a securitization may include auto loans to individuals
and to business enterprises. If these auto loans are
predominantly loans to individuals, all of the requested
information about this securitization should be included
in Column D, Auto Loans.
Deﬁnitions
For purposes of this schedule, the following deﬁnitions
of terms are applicable.
FR Y-9C
HC-S-1
Schedule HC-S
December 2019

Recourse or other seller-provided credit enhancement
means an arrangement in which the reporting institution
retains, in form or in substance, any risk of credit loss
directly or indirectly associated with a transferred (sold)
asset that exceeds its pro rata claim on the asset. It
also includes a representation or warranty extended by
the reporting institution when it transfers an asset, or
assumed by the institution when it services a transferred
asset, that obligates the institution to absorb credit losses
on the transferred asset. Such an arrangement typically
exists when the institution transfers assets and agrees to
protect purchasers or some other party, e.g., investors in
securitized assets, from losses due to default by or
nonperformance of the obligor on the transferred assets
or some other party. The reporting institution provides
this protection by retaining:
(1) an interest in the transferred assets, e.g., credit-
enhancing interest-only strips, “spread” accounts,
subordinated interests or securities, collateral invested
amounts, and cash collateral accounts, that absorbs
losses, or
(2) an obligation to repurchase the transferred assets
in the event of a default of principal or interest on the
transferred assets or any other deﬁciency in the perfor-
mance of the underlying obligor or some other party.
Credit-enhancing interest-only strip, as deﬁned in the
regulatory capital standards, means an on-balance sheet
asset that, in form or in substance: (i) represents the
contractual right to receive some or all of the interest due
on transferred assets; and (ii) exposes the holding com-
pany to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with
the transferred assets that exceeds a pro rata share of the
holding company’s claim on the assets, whether through
subordination provisions or other credit enhancement
techniques. Credit-enhancing interest-only strips include
other similar “spread” assets and can be either retained or
purchased.
Subordinated interests and subordinated securities
retained by the institution when it securitizes assets
expose the institution to more than its pro rata share of
loss and thus are considered a form of credit enhance-
ment to the securitization structure.
Liquidity facility means any arrangement, including ser-
vicer cash advances, in which the reporting institution is
obligated to provide funding to a securitization structure
to ensure investors of timely payments on issued securi-
ties, e.g., by smoothing timing differences in the receipt
of interest and principal payments on the underlying
securitized assets, or to ensure investors of payments in
the event of market disruptions. Advances under such a
facility are typically reimbursed from subsequent collec-
tions by the securitization structure and are not sub-
ordinated to other claims on the cash ﬂows from the
underlying assets and, therefore, should generally not be
construed to be a form of credit enhancement. However,
if the advances under such a facility are subordinated to
other claims on the cash ﬂows, the facility should be
treated as a credit enhancement for purposes of this
schedule.
Seller’s interest means the reporting institution’s owner-
ship interest in loans that have been securitized, except an
interest that is a form of recourse or other seller-provided
credit enhancement. Seller’s interests should be reported
on Schedule HC—Balance Sheet—as securities or as
loans depending on the form in which the interest is held.
However, seller’s interests differ from the securities
issued to investors by the securitization structure. The
principal amount of a seller’s interest is generally equal
to the total principal amount of the pool of assets
included in the securitization structure less the principal
amount of those assets attributable to investors, i.e., in
the form of securities issued to investors.
Bank Securitization Activities
A holding company should report information in Sched-
ule HC-S, items 1 through 6, only for those securitiza-
tions for which the transferred assets qualify for sale
accounting or are otherwise not carried as assets on the
holding company’s consolidated balance sheet.
Line Item Instructions

card fees and ﬁnance charges that the reporting holding
company has securitized and sold in connection with its
securitization and sale of credit card receivable balances.

reporting holding company has (1) pooled into securities
that have been guaranteed by the Government National
Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) and (2) sold with

recourse under Section 208 of the Riegle Community
Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994
that the reporting holding company has securitized and
sold.

interests owned by the reporting institution; report the
amount of seller’s interests in Schedule HC-S, item 6.
Do not report in this item the outstanding balance of 1–4
family residential mortgages sold to the Federal National
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home

government-sponsored agency in turn securitizes. Do not
report in this item the outstanding balance of 1–4 family
residential mortgages sold to a Federal Home Loan Bank
(FHLB) through a Mortgage Partnership Finance Pro-
gram that the FHLB in turn securitizes. Report 1–4
family residential mortgages sold to Fannie Mae, Fred-
die Mac, or FHLB with recourse or other seller-provided
credit enhancements in Schedule HC-S, item 11, col-
umn A, and report the maximum credit exposure arising
from the enhancements in item 12, column A. If servic-
ing has been retained on the 1–4 family residential
mortgages sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or FHLB,
report the outstanding principal balance of the mortgages
in Schedule HC-S, Memorandum item 2(a) or 2(b)
depending on whether the servicing is performed with
or without recourse or other servicer-provided credit
enhancements. If the reporting institution has both retained
the servicing and provided credit enhancements, report
the principal balance of the 1–4 family residential mort-
gages in Schedule HC-S, item 11, column A, and in
Memorandum item 2(a).
Exclude securitizations that have been accounted for as
secured borrowings because the transactions do not meet
the criteria for sale accounting under generally accepted
accounting principles. The securitized loans, leases, and
other assets should continue to be carried as assets on the
reporting institution’s balance sheet.

Report in the appropriate subitem the unused portions of
commitments provided by the reporting institution that
function as liquidity facilities to asset-backed commer-
cial paper conduit structures. Typically, these facilities
take the form of a Backstop Line (Loan Agreement) or an
Asset Purchase Agreement. Under a backstop line, the
reporting institution advances funds to the conduit when
a draw is required under the liquidity facility. The
advance is secured by the cash ﬂow of the underlying
asset pools. Under an asset purchase agreement, the
reporting institution purchases a speciﬁc pool of assets
from the conduit when a draw is required under the
liquidity facility. Typically, the reporting institution is
repaid from the cash ﬂow on the purchased assets or from
the sale of the purchased pool of assets.

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Variable Interest Entities
Schedule HC-V
General Instructions
A variable interest entity (VIE), as described in ASC
Topic 810, Consolidation, is an entity in which equity
investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for that
entity to ﬁnance its activities without additional subordi-
nated ﬁnancial support or, as a group, the holders of the
equity investment at risk lack one or more of the follow-
ing three characteristics: (a) the power, through voting
rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of an entity
that most signiﬁcantly impact the entity’s economic
performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected
losses of the entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected
residual returns of the entity.
Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership, or
other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with
changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets
exclusive of variable interests. When a holding company
or other company has a variable interest or interests in a
VIE, ASC Topic 810 provides guidance for determining
whether the holding company or other company must
consolidate the VIE. If a holding company or other
company has a controlling ﬁnancial interest in a VIE, it is
deemed to be the primary beneﬁciary of the VIE and,
therefore, must consolidate the VIE. For further informa-
tion, see the Glossary entry for ”Variable Interest Entity.”
Schedule HC-V collects information on VIEs that have
been consolidated by the reporting holding company
because the holding company or a consolidated subsidi-
ary is the primary beneﬁciary of the VIE. Schedule HC-V
should be completed by holding companies with $5 bil-
lion or more in total assets on a fully consolidated basis,
i.e., after eliminating intercompany transactions.
Report the asset amounts in Schedule HC-V net of any
applicable allowances for credit losses included in
amounts reported on Schedule HC, Balance Sheet.
Column Instructions
Column A, Securitization Vehicles:
Securitization
vehicles include VIEs that have been created to pool and
repackage mortgages, other assets, or other credit expo-
sures into securities that can be transferred to investors.
Column B, Other VIEs:
Other VIEs are VIEs other
than securitization vehicles. Other VIEs include asset-
backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits.
For purposes of items 1 through 4 of Schedule HC-V,
information about each consolidated VIE should be
included in only one of the two columns of the schedule.
The column selected for a particular consolidated VIE
should be based on the purpose and design of the VIE
and this column should be used consistently over time.

LINE ITEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR
Notes to the Balance Sheet
Predecessor Financial Items
General Instructions
This one-time reporting schedule is event-driven. An
event for reporting the average balance sheet items below
is deﬁned as a business combination that occurred during
the quarter (that is, the holding company consummated a
merger or acquisition within the quarter). Complete this
schedule only if the combined assets of the acquired
entity(ies) are at least equal to $10 billion or 5 percent of
the reporting holding company’s total consolidated assets
at the previous quarter-end, whichever is less.
Report in accordance with these instructions the selected
quarterly average information for any acquired compa-
ny(ies), the predecessor, as described above. For the
items on this schedule, report the average of the balances
as of the close of business for each day for the calendar
quarter up to the date of acquisition or an average of the
balances as of the close of business on each Wednesday
during the calendar quarter up to date of acquisition. For
days that the acquired company or any of its consolidated
subsidiaries were closed (e.g., Saturdays, Sundays, or
holidays), use the amount outstanding from the previous
business day. An office is considered closed if there are
no transactions posted to the general ledger as of that
date.
Only a single schedule should be completed with aggre-
gated information for all entities acquired during the
quarter. The combined assets of these ﬁrms should at
least equal $10 billion or 5 percent of the respondent’s
total consolidated assets at the previous quarter-end,
whichever is less.
The reporting holding company may report the items
below, net of merger-related adjustments, if any.
In the unlikely event that only a portion of a ﬁrm was
purchased and actual ﬁnancial statements for the acquired
operations are not readily available, the reporting holding
company may provide estimates in lieu of inaccessible
actual data.
If a single transaction business combination occurred
where the acquiree was another holding company that
ﬁled the FR Y-9C in the preceding quarter, and the
combination occurred on the ﬁrst day of the quarter, that
event is exempt from being reported on this schedule.
This exemption also applies if all entities acquired on the
ﬁrst day of the quarter were FR Y-9C ﬁlers as of the prior
quarter.
The line item instructions should be read in conjunction
with the instructions for Schedule HC-K, ‘‘Quarterly
Averages.’’
Line Item 1
Average loans and leases (held for
investment and held for sale).
Report the quarterly average for all loans and leases, held
for investment and held for sale, in both domestic and
foreign offices of the acquired company (as deﬁned for
Schedule HC-C, items 1 through 11).

quarterly average total consolidated assets for purposes
of this schedule, reﬂect all debt securities (not held for
trading) at amortized cost, available-for-sale equity secu-
rities with readily determinable fair values at the lower of
cost or fair value, and equity securities without readily
determinable fair values at historical cost. In addition, to
the extent that net deferred tax assets included in the
acquired company’s total assets, if any, include the
deferred tax effects of any unrealized holding gains and
losses on available-for-sale debt securities, these deferred
tax effects may be excluded from the determination of the
quarterly average for total consolidated assets. If these
deferred tax effects are excluded, this treatment must be
followed consistently over time.
Line Item 4
Average equity capital (excludes
limited-life preferred stock).
Report the quarterly average for the fully consolidated
equity capital (as deﬁned for Schedule HC, item 28) of
the acquired company. For purposes of this schedule,
deduct net unrealized losses on marketable equity securi-
ties and exclude other net unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities, and accumulated net gains
(losses) on cash ﬂow hedges when calculating average
equity capital.

Glossary
The deﬁnitions in this Glossary apply to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for Holding Companies (FR Y-9C)
and are not necessarily applicable for other regulatory or
legal purposes. The presentation of the assets, liabilities,
and stockholders’ equity, and the recognition of income
and expenses in the FR Y-9C are to be in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The
accounting discussions in this Glossary are those relevant
to the preparation of these reports and are not intended to
constitute a comprehensive presentation on bank account-
ing or on generally accepted accounting principles. For
purposes of this Glossary, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codiﬁ-
cation is referred to as “ASC.”
Acceptances: See “Bankers’ acceptances.”
Accounting Changes: Changes in accounting principles–
The accounting principles that holding companies have
adopted for the preparation of their FR Y-9C should be
changed only if (a) the change is required by a newly
issued accounting pronouncement or (b) the holding
company can justify the use of an allowable alternative
accounting principle on the basis that it is preferable
when there are two or more generally accepted account-
ing principles for a type of event or transaction. If a
holding company changes from the use of one acceptable
accounting principle to one that is more preferable at any
time during the calendar year, it must report the income
or expense item(s) affected by the change for the entire
year on the basis of the newly adopted accounting
principle regardless of the date when the change is
actually made. However, a change from an accounting
principle that is neither accepted nor sanctioned by the
Federal Reserve to one that is acceptable to the Federal
Reserve is to be reported as a correction of an error as
discussed below.
New accounting pronouncements that are adopted by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (or such other
body officially designated to establish accounting prin-
ciples) generally include transition guidance on how to
initially apply the pronouncement. In general, the pro-
nouncements require (or allow) a holding company to use
one of the following approaches, collectively referred to
as “retrospective application”:
• apply a different accounting principle to one or more
previously issued ﬁnancial statements; or
• make a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earn-
ings, assets, and/or liabilities at the beginning of the
period as if that principle had always been used.
Because each Report of Income covers a single discrete
period, only the second approach under retrospective
application is permitted in the FR Y-9C. Therefore, when
an accounting pronouncement requires the application of
either of the approaches under retrospective application,
holding companies must report the effect on the amount
of retained earnings at the beginning of the year in which
the new pronouncement is ﬁrst adopted for purposes of
the FR Y-9C (net of applicable income taxes, if any) as a
direct adjustment to equity capital in Schedule HI-A,
item 2.
In the FR Y-9C in which a change in accounting prin-
ciple is ﬁrst reﬂected, the holding company is encouraged
to include an explanation of the nature and reason for the
change in accounting principle in the ‘‘Notes to the
Income Statement–Other.’’
Changes in accounting estimates–Accounting and the
preparation of ﬁnancial statements involve the use of
estimates. As more current information becomes known,
estimates may be changed. In particular, accruals are
derived from estimates based on judgments about the
outcome of future events and changes in these estimates
are an inherent part of accrual accounting.
Reasonable changes in accounting estimates do not
require the restatement of amounts of income and
FR Y-9C
GL-1
Glossary

expenses and assets, liabilities, and capital reported in
previously submitted FR Y-9C reports. Computation of
the cumulative effect of these changes is also not ordinar-
ily necessary. Rather, the effect of such changes is
handled on a prospective basis. That is, beginning in the
period when an accounting estimate is revised, the related
item of income or expense for that period is adjusted
accordingly. For example, if the holding company’s
estimate of the remaining useful life of certain holding
company equipment is increased, the remaining undepre-
ciated cost of the equipment would be spread over its
revised remaining useful life. Similarly, immaterial
accrual adjustments to items of income and expenses,
including provisions for credit losses and income taxes,
are considered changes in accounting estimates and
would be taken into account by adjusting the affected
income and expense accounts for the year in which the
adjustments were found to be appropriate.
However, large and unusual changes in accounting esti-
mates may be more properly treated as constituting
accounting errors, and if so, must be reported accordingly
as described below.
Corrections of accounting errors – A holding company
may become aware of an error in its FR Y-9C after it has
been submitted to the Federal Reserve through either its
own or the Federal Reserve’s discovery of the error. An
error in the recognition, measurement, or presentation of
an event or transaction included in a report for a prior
period may result from:
• a mathematical mistake;
• a mistake in applying accounting principles; or
• the oversight or misuse of facts that existed when the
FR Y-9C for prior periods were prepared.
According to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Finan-
cial Statements (SAB 108, Topic 1.N. in the Codiﬁcation
of Staff Accounting Bulletins), the effects of prior year
errors or misstatements (“carryover effects”) should be
considered when quantifying misstatements identiﬁed in
current year ﬁnancial statements. SAB 108 describes two
methods for accumulating and quantifying misstate-
ments. These methods are referred to as the “rollover”
and “iron curtain” approaches:
• The rollover approach ‘‘quantiﬁes a misstatement
based on the amount of the error originating in the
current year income statement’’ only and ignores the
‘‘carryover effects’’ of any related prior year misstate-
ments. The primary weakness of the rollover approach
is that it fails to consider the effects of correcting the
portion of the current year balance sheet misstatement
that originated in prior years.
• The iron curtain approach ‘‘quantiﬁes a misstatement
based on the effects of correcting the misstatement
existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current
year, irrespective of the misstatement’s year(s) of
origination.’’ The primary weakness of the iron curtain
approach is that it does not consider the correction of
prior year misstatements in the current year ﬁnancial
statements to be errors because the prior year misstate-
ments were considered immaterial in the year(s) of
origination. Thus, there could be a material misstate-
ment in the current year income statement because the
correction of the accumulated immaterial amounts
from prior years is not evaluated as an error.
Because of the weaknesses in these two approaches, SAB
108 states that the impact of correcting all misstatements
on current year ﬁnancial statements should be accom-
plished by quantifying an error under both the rollover
and iron curtain approaches and by evaluating the error
measured under each approach. When either approach
results in a misstatement that is material, after consider-
ing all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, an
adjustment to the ﬁnancial statements would be required.
Guidance on the consideration of all relevant factors
when assessing the materiality of misstatements is pro-
vided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materi-
ality (SAB 99) (codiﬁed as Topic 1.M. in the Codiﬁcation
of Staff Accounting Bulletins).
For purposes of the FR Y-9C, all holding companies
should follow the sound accounting practices described
in SAB 108 and SAB 99. Accordingly, holding compa-
nies should quantify the impact of correcting misstate-
ments, including both the carryover and reversing effects
of prior year misstatements, on their current year reports
by applying both the “rollover” and “iron curtain”
approaches and evaluating the impact of the error mea-
sured under each approach. When the misstatement that
exists after recording the adjustment in the current year
FR Y-9C is material (considering all relevant quantitative
and qualitative factors), the appropriate prior year report(s)
Glossary
GL-2
FR Y-9C
Glossary
June 2020

should be amended, even though such revision previ-
ously was and continues to be immaterial to the prior
year report(s). If the misstatement that exists after record-
ing the adjustment in the current year FR Y-9C is not
material, then amending the immaterial errors in prior
year reports would not be necessary.
When the Federal Reserve determines that the holding
company’s FR Y-9C contains a material accounting
error, the holding company may be directed to ﬁle
amended condition and/or income report data for each
prior period that was signiﬁcantly affected by the error.
Normally, such reﬁlings will not result in restatements of
reports for periods exceeding ﬁve years. If amended
reports are not required, the holding company should
report the effect of such corrections on retained earnings
at the beginning of the year, net of applicable income
taxes, in Schedule HI-A, item 2, ‘‘Cumulative effect of
changes in accounting principles and corrections of mate-
rial accounting errors.’’ The effect of such corrections on
income and expenses since the beginning of the year in
which the error is discovered should be reﬂected in each
affected income and expense account on a year-to-date
basis in the next quarterly FR Y-9C to be ﬁled and not as
a direct adjustment to retained earnings.
In addition, a change from an accounting principle that is
neither accepted nor sanctioned by the Federal Reserve to
one that is acceptable to the Federal Reserve is to be
reported as a correction of an error. When such a change
is implemented, the cumulative effect that applies to prior
periods, calculated in the same manner as described
above for other changes in accounting principles, should
be reported in Schedule HI-A, item 2, ‘‘Cumulative effect
of changes in accounting principles and corrections of
material accounting errors. ’’ In most cases of this kind
undertaken voluntarily by the reporting holding company
in order to adopt more acceptable accounting practices,
such a change will not result in a request for amended
reports for prior periods unless substantial distortions in
the holding company’s previously reported results are in
evidence.
In the FR Y-9C in which the correction of an error is ﬁrst
reﬂected, the holding company is encouraged to include
an explanation of the nature and reason for the correction
in the ‘‘Notes to the Income Statement—Other.’’

reported for the related ﬁnancial asset (e.g., loans,
leases, debt securities, and other interest-bearing
assets) on Schedule HC, Balance Sheet (rather than
as a component of the balance sheet amount reported
for the related ﬁnancial asset), should report the
accrued interest receivable in Schedule HC-F, item 1,
“Accrued interest receivable.”
(2) Holding companies that charge off uncollectible
accrued interest receivable in a timely manner, i.e., in
accordance with the Glossary entry for “Nonaccrual
Status,” may elect, at the class of ﬁnancing receiv-
able or the major security-type level, not to measure
an ACL for accrued interest receivable. If a holding
company does not make this policy election, for a
particular class of ﬁnancing receivable or major
security type, the holding company should measure
an ACL on accrued interest receivable for that class
of ﬁnancing receivable or major security type.
(3) A holding company may make a separate policy
election, at the class of ﬁnancing receivable or major
security-type level, to charge off any uncollectible

accrued interest receivable by reversing interest
income, recognizing credit loss expense (i.e., provi-
sion expense), or a combination of both. If a holding
company reverses interest income, the holding com-
pany should debit (i.e., reduce) the appropriate cate-
gory of interest income on Schedule HI, Income
Statement, for the amount of uncollectible accrued
interest receivable being charged off. Furthermore,
for purposes of these reports, a holding company
may charge off uncollectible accrued interest receiv-
able against an ACL by debiting (i.e., reducing)
the ACL.

Losses,” “Amortized Cost Basis,” and “Nonaccrual Sta-
tus.”
Accrued Interest Receivable Related to Credit Card
Securitizations: In a typical credit card securitization, an
institution transfers a pool of receivables and the right to
receive the future collections of principal (credit card
purchases and cash advances), ﬁnance charges, and fees
on the receivables to a trust. If a securitization transaction
qualiﬁes as a sale under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and
Servicing, the selling institution removes the receivables
that were sold from its reported assets and continues to
carry any retained interests in the transferred receivables
on its balance sheet. The ‘‘accrued interest receivable’’
(AIR) asset typically consists of the seller’s retained
interest in the investor’s portion of (1) the accrued fees
and ﬁnance charges that have been billed to customer
accounts, but have not yet been collected (‘‘billed but
uncollected’’), and (2) the right to ﬁnance charges that
have been accrued on cardholder accounts, but have not
yet been billed (‘‘accrued but unbilled’’).
While the selling institution retains a right to the excess
cash ﬂows generated from the fees and ﬁnance charges
collected on the transferred receivables, the institution
generally subordinates its right to these cash ﬂows to the
investors in the securitization. If and when cash pay-
ments on the accrued fees and ﬁnance charges are
collected, they ﬂow through the trust, where they are
available to satisfy more senior obligations before any
excess amount is remitted to the seller. Only after trust
expenses (such as servicing fees, investor certiﬁcate
interest, and investor principal charge-offs) have been
paid will the trustee distribute any excess fee and ﬁnance
charge cash ﬂow back to the seller. Since investors are
paid from these cash collections before the selling insti-
tution receives the amount of AIR that is due, the seller
may or may not realize the full amount of its AIR asset.
Accounting at Inception of the Securitization Transaction
Generally, if a securitization transaction meets the criteria
for
sale
treatment
and
the
AIR
is
subordinated
either because the asset has been isolated from the
transferor1 or because of the operation of the cash ﬂow
distribution (or ‘‘waterfall’’) through the securitization
trust, the total AIR asset (both the “billed and uncol-
lected” and ‘‘accrued and unbilled’’) should be consid-
ered one of the components of the sale transaction. Thus,
when accounting for a credit card securitization, an
institution should allocate the previous carrying amount
of the AIR (net of any related allowance for uncollectible
amounts) and the other transferred assets between the
assets that are sold and the retained interests, based on
their relative fair values at the date of transfer. As a
result, after a securitization, the allocated carrying amount
of the AIR asset will typically be lower than its face
amount.
Subsequent Accounting
After securitization, the AIR asset should be accounted
for at its allocated cost basis (as discussed above). In
addition, an institution should treat the AIR asset as a
retained (subordinated) beneﬁcial interest. Accordingly,
it should be reported as an ‘‘Other Asset’’ in Schedule
HC-F, item 6, and in Schedule HC-S, item 2(b), column
C (if reported as a stand-alone asset) and not as a loan
receivable.
Although the AIR asset is a retained beneﬁcial interest in
transferred assets, it is not required to be subsequently
measured like an investment in debt securities classiﬁed
as available for sale or trading under ASC Topic 320,
Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, and ASC Topic
860, because the AIR asset cannot be contractually
prepaid or settled in such a way that the holder would not
recover substantially all of its recorded investment.
Rather, institutions should follow existing applicable
accounting standards, including ASC Subtopic 450-20,
Contingencies–Loss
Contingencies,
in
subsequent
accounting for the AIR asset. ASC Subtopic 450-20
addresses the accounting for various loss contingencies,
including the collectibility of receivables.

For further guidance, holding companies should refer to
the Interagency Advisory on the Accounting Treatment
of Accrued Interest Receivable Related to Credit Card
Securitizations dated December 4, 2002. See also the
Glossary entry for ”Transfers of Financial Assets.”
Acquisition, Development, or Construction (ADC)
Arrangements: An ADC arrangement is an arrangement
in which a holding company or its consolidated subsidi-
aries provide ﬁnancing for real estate acquisition, devel-
opment, or construction purposes and participates in the
expected residual proﬁt resulting from the ultimate sale
or other use of the property. ADC arrangements should
be reported as loans, real estate joint ventures, or direct
investments in real estate in accordance with ASC Sub-
topic 310-10, Receivables – Overall.
Under the Board’s regulatory capital rules, the term high
volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposure is
deﬁned, in part, to mean a credit facility that, prior to
conversion to permanent ﬁnancing, ﬁnances or has
ﬁnanced the acquisition, development, or construction of
real property. (See §.2 of the regulatory capital rules and
the instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 4.b.)
Holding companies should note that the meaning of the
term ADC as used in the deﬁnition of HVCRE exposure
in the regulatory capital rules differs from the meaning of
ADC arrangement for accounting purposes in ASC Sub-
topic 310-10 as described above in this Glossary entry.
For example, a holding companies participation in the
expected residual proﬁt from a property is part of the
accounting deﬁnition of an ADC arrangement, but whether
the holding company participates in the expected residual
proﬁt is not a consideration for purposes of determining
whether a credit facility is an HVCRE exposure for
regulatory capital purposes. Thus, a loan can be treated as
an HVCRE exposure for regulatory capital purposes even
though it does not provide for the holding company to
participate in the property’s expected residual proﬁt.
Allowances for Credit Losses: For more information on
allowances for credit losses (ACL), institutions should
also refer to the Interagency Policy Statement on Allow-
ances for Credit Losses (Revised April 2023).
Standards for accounting for an ACL for ﬁnancial assets
measured at amortized cost and net investments in leases
(hereafter referred to collectively as ﬁnancial assets
measured at amortized cost), as well as certain off-
balance sheet credit exposures, are set forth in ASC
Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—
Measured at Amortized Cost. For ﬁnancial assets mea-
sured at amortized cost, the ACL is a valuation account
that is deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost
basis of ﬁnancial assets to present the net amount
expected to be collected over the contractual term of the
ﬁnancial assets.
Standards for measuring credit losses on available-for-
sale (AFS) debt securities are set forth in ASC Sub-
topic 326-30, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—
Available-for-Sale Debt Securities. See the Glossary
entry for “Securities Activities” for guidance on allow-
ances for credit losses on AFS debt securities.
The following sections of this Glossary entry apply to
ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost and also to
off-balance sheet credit exposures within the scope of
ASC Subtopic 326-20.
Measurement—An ACL shall be established upon the
origination or acquisition of a ﬁnancial asset(s) measured
at amortized cost. A separate ACL shall be reported for
each type of ﬁnancial asset measured at amortized cost
(e.g., loans and leases held for investment, held-to-
maturity (HTM) debt securities, and receivables that
relate to repurchase agreements and securities lending
agreements) as of the end of each reporting period.
As of the end of each quarter, or more frequently if
warranted, each holding company must evaluate the
collectability of its ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized
cost, including, if applicable, any recorded accrued inter-
est receivable (i.e., not already reversed or charged off, as
applicable), and make adjusting entries to maintain the
balance of each of the separate ACLs reported on the
balance sheet at an appropriate level.
A holding company shall measure expected credit losses
on a collective or pool basis when ﬁnancial assets share
similar risk characteristics. If a ﬁnancial asset does not
share similar risk characteristics with other assets,
expected credit losses for that asset should be evaluated
individually. Individually evaluated assets should not be
included in a collective assessment of expected credit
losses. If a ﬁnancial asset ceases to share similar risk
characteristics with other assets in its pool, it should be
moved to a different pool with assets sharing similar risk
characteristics, if such a pool exists.
ASC Subtopic 326-20 generally does not require the use
of a speciﬁc loss estimation method for purposes of
determining ACLs. Various methods may be used to
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-5
Glossary
December 2024

estimate the expected collectibility of ﬁnancial assets
measured at amortized cost, with those methods gener-
ally applied consistently over time. The same loss estima-
tion method does not need to be applied to all ﬁnancial
assets. A holding company is not precluded from select-
ing a different method when it determines the method
will result in a better estimate of ACLs.
ASC Subtopic 326-20 requires a holding company to
measure estimated expected credit losses over the con-
tractual term of its ﬁnancial assets, considering expected
prepayments. Renewals, extensions, and modiﬁcations
are excluded from the contractual term of a ﬁnancial
asset for purposes of estimating the ACL unless the
renewal and extension options are part of the original or
modiﬁed contract and are not unconditionally cancellable
by the holding company. If such renewal or extension
options are present, a holding company must evaluate the
likelihood of a borrower exercising those options when
determining the contractual term.
In estimating the net amount expected to be collected on
ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost, a holding
company should consider the effects of past events,
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable fore-
casts on the collectibility of the holding company’s
ﬁnancial assets. Under ASC Subtopic 326-20, a holding
company is required to use relevant forward-looking
information and expectations drawn from reasonable and
supportable forecasts when estimating expected credit
losses.
Expected recoveries, prior to collection, are a component
of management’s estimate of the net amount expected to
be collected for a ﬁnancial asset. Expected recoveries of
amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged
off that are included in ACLs may not exceed the
aggregate amounts previously charged off or expected to
be charged off. All assumptions related to expected
recoveries should be appropriately documented and sup-
ported. When estimating expected recoveries, manage-
ment may conclude that amounts previously charged off
are not collectible.
Changes in the ACL —Additions to, or reductions of, the
ACL to adjust its level to management’s current estimate
of expected credit losses are to be made through charges
or credits to the “provision for credit losses” (provision)
in item 4 of Schedule HI, Income Statement, including
for changes to adjust the level of the ACL for off-balance-
sheet credit exposures. When available information con-
ﬁrms that speciﬁc ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized
cost, or portions thereof, are uncollectible, these amounts
should be promptly charged off against the related ACL
in the period in which the ﬁnancial assets are deemed
uncollectible. Under no circumstances can amounts deter-
mined to be uncollectible on speciﬁc ﬁnancial assets
measured at amortized cost be charged directly to
“Retained earnings.”
Recoveries on ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized
cost represent collections on amounts that were previ-
ously charged off against the related ACL. Recoveries
shall be credited to the ACL, provided that the total
amount credited to the ACL as recoveries on a ﬁnancial
asset (which may include amounts representing principal,
interest, and fees) is limited to the amount previously
charged off against the ACL on that ﬁnancial asset. Any
amounts collected in excess of this limit should generally
be recognized as noninterest income upon collection.
Charge-Offs and Establishment of a New Amortized Cost
Basis—When a holding company makes a full or partial
charge-off of a ﬁnancial asset measured at amortized cost
that is deemed uncollectible, the holding company estab-
lishes a new cost basis for that ﬁnancial asset. Conse-
quently, once a new cost basis has been established for a
ﬁnancial asset through a charge-off, this amortized cost
basis may not be directly “written up” at a later date.
Reversing the previous charge-off and “re-booking” the
charged-off asset after the holding company concludes
that the prospects for recovering the charge-off have
improved, regardless of whether the holding company
assigns a new account number to the asset or the bor-
rower signs a new note, is not an acceptable accounting
practice. Nevertheless, as stated above, management’s
estimate of the net amount expected to be collected for a
ﬁnancial asset, as reﬂected in the related ACL, considers
expected recoveries.
If losses charged off against an ACL exceed the amount
of the ACL, a provision expense sufficient to restore the
ACL to an appropriate level must be charged to a
provision for credit losses on the income statement
during the reporting period in which the charge-off is
recorded. A holding company shall not increase an ACL
by transferring an amount from retained earnings or any
segregation thereof to the ACL.
Collateral-Dependent Financial Assets—A collateral-
dependent ﬁnancial asset is a ﬁnancial asset for which
repayment is expected to be provided substantially
Glossary
GL-6
FR Y-9C
Glossary
December 2024

through the operation or sale of the collateral when the
borrower, based on management’s assessment, is experi-
encing ﬁnancial difficulty as of the reporting date.
For purposes of these reports, the ACL for a collateral-
dependent loan is measured using the fair value of
collateral, regardless of whether foreclosure is probable.
This application of this requirement for purposes of these
reports is limited to collateral-dependent loans; it does
not apply to other ﬁnancial assets such as held-to-
maturity debt securities that are collateral dependent.
When estimating the ACL for a collateral-dependent
loan, the fair value of collateral should be adjusted to
consider estimated costs to sell if repayment or satisfac-
tion of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. ACL
adjustments for estimated costs to sell are not appropriate
when the repayment of a collateral-dependent loan is
expected from the operation of the collateral.
The fair value of collateral securing a collateral-
dependent loan may change over time. If the fair value of
the collateral as of the ACL evaluation date has decreased
since the previous ACL evaluation date, the ACL should
be increased to reﬂect the additional decrease in the fair
value of the collateral. Likewise, if the fair value of the
collateral has increased as of the ACL evaluation date,
the increase in the fair value of the collateral is reﬂected
through a reduction in the ACL. Any negative ACL that
results is capped at the amount previously charged off. In
general, any portion of the amortized cost basis in excess
of the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell,
if applicable, that can be identiﬁed as uncollectible
should be promptly charged off against the ACL.
Financial
Assets
with
Collateral
Maintenance
Agreements—Holding companies may have ﬁnancial
assets that are secured by collateral (such as debt securi-
ties) and are subject to collateral maintenance agreements
requiring the borrower to continuously replenish the
amount of collateral securing the asset. If the fair value of
the collateral declines, the borrower is required to pro-
vide additional collateral as speciﬁed by the agreement.
ASC Topic 326 includes a practical expedient for ﬁnan-
cial assets with collateral maintenance agreements where
the borrower is required to provide collateral greater than
or equal to the amortized cost basis of the asset and is
expected to continuously replenish the collateral. In those
cases, the holding company may elect the collateral
maintenance practical expedient and measure expected
credit losses for these qualifying assets based on the fair
value of the collateral. If the fair value of the collateral is
greater than the amortized cost basis of the ﬁnancial asset
and the holding company expects the borrower to replen-
ish collateral as needed, the holding company may record
an ACL of zero for the ﬁnancial asset when the collateral
maintenance practical expedient is applied. Similarly, if
the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized
cost basis of the ﬁnancial asset and the holding company
expects the borrower to replenish collateral as needed,
the ACL is limited to the difference between the fair
value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the
asset as of the reporting date when applying the collateral
maintenance practical expedient.
Loan Modiﬁcations_A holding company should measure
any expected credit losses on loans whose terms have
been modiﬁed in accordance with ASC Topic 326.
ASC Topic 326 allows a holding company to use any
appropriate loss estimation method to estimate allow-
ances for credit losses. However, there are circumstances
when speciﬁc measurement methods are required.
For reporting purposes, the ACL of a collateral depen-
dent loan must be estimated using the fair value of
collateral, less cost to sell, as appropriate. A holding
company measuring the allowance using the present
value of expected future cash ﬂow method (i.e., dis-
counted cash ﬂow method should use the post-
modiﬁcation effective interest rate as the discount rate.)
If a holding company adopted ASU 2022-02, “Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures,” using the pro-
spective method (versus the modiﬁed retrospective
method), loans previously identiﬁed as troubled debt
restructurings should retain the existing method for mea-
surement purposes. As such, unless the loan is collateral-
dependent, an institution should continue to apply a
discounted cash ﬂow method, discounted at the loan’s
original effective interest to estimate expected credit
losses until the loan is subsequently modiﬁed or settled.
Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures—Each holding com-
pany should also estimate, as a separate liability account,
expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit expo-
sures not accounted for as insurance, over the contractual
period during which the holding company is exposed to
credit risk. The estimate of expected credit losses should
take into consideration the likelihood that funding will
occur as well as the amount expected to be funded over
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-7
Glossary
December 2024

the estimated remaining contractual term of the off-
balance-sheet credit exposures. Off-balance sheet credit
exposures include loan commitments, ﬁnancial standby
letters of credit, and ﬁnancial guarantees not accounted
for as insurance, and other similar instruments except for
those within the scope of ASC Topic 815 on derivatives
and hedging. This separate allowance should be reported
in Schedule HC-G, item 3, “Allowance for credit losses
on off-balance-sheet credit exposures,” not as part of the
“Allowance for credit losses on loans and leases” in
Schedule HC, item 4.c. Additions to, or reductions of, the
allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit
exposures to adjust the balance of the allowance to an
appropriate level should be reported in net income,
Schedule HI, item 4, “Provision for credit losses.”
Holding companies should not record an estimate of
expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit expo-
sures that are unconditionally cancellable by the issuer.
For example, for a holding company that has unfunded
commitments (i.e., available credit) on credit cards, the
holding company should not record an allowance for
expected credit losses for unfunded commitments for
which the holding company has the ability to uncondi-
tionally cancel the available line of credit. In contrast,
home equity lines of credit may be deemed uncondition-
ally cancellable for regulatory capital purposes. How-
ever, unfunded commitments under home equity lines of
credit are not considered unconditionally cancellable by
the issuer for purposes of estimating expected credit
losses under ASC Topic 326, because the lender may not
unilaterally refuse to extend credit under the commit-
ment.
Recourse Liability Accounts—Recourse liability accounts
that arise from recourse obligations for any transfers of
ﬁnancial assets that are reported as sales should not be
included in an ACL. These accounts are considered
separate and distinct from ACLs and from the allowance
for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures.
Recourse liability accounts should be reported in Sched-
ule HC-G, item 4, “All other liabilities.”

Amortized Cost Basis: The amortized cost basis is the
amount at which a ﬁnancing receivable or investment is

and net deferred fees or costs, collection of cash, write-
offs,2 foreign exchange, and fair hedge accounting adjust-
ments.

Bankers’ Acceptances: A banker’s acceptance, for pur-
poses of these reports, is a draft or bill of exchange that
has been drawn on and accepted by a banking institution
(the “accepting bank”) or its agent for payment by that
institution at a future date that is speciﬁed in the instru-
ment. Funds are advanced to the drawer of the acceptance
by the discounting of the accepted draft either by the
accepting bank or by others; the accepted draft is nego-
tiable and may be sold and resold subsequent to its
original discounting. At the maturity date speciﬁed, the
holder or owner of the acceptance at that date, who has
advanced funds either by initial discount or subsequent
purchase, presents the accepted draft to the accepting
bank for payment.
The accepting bank has an unconditional obligation to
put the holder in funds (to pay the holder the face amount
of the draft) on presentation on the speciﬁed date. The
account party (customer) has an unconditional obligation
to put the accepting bank in funds at or before the
maturity date speciﬁed in the instrument.
The following description covers the treatment in the
FR Y-9C of (1) acceptances that have been executed by
a bank subsidiary of the reporting holding company, that
is, those drafts that have been drawn on and accepted by a
subsidiary bank; (2) “participations” in acceptances, that
is, “participations” in the accepting bank’s obligation to
put the holder of the acceptance in funds at maturity, or
participations in the accepting bank’s risk of loss in the
event of default by the account party; and (3) acceptances
2. The FASB’s term “write-off” is used interchangeably with the term
“charge-off” in these instructions. These terms can refer to both full and
partial write-offs or charge-offs.

owned by the reporting holding company or its subsidi-
aries, that is, those acceptances— whether executed by
the reporting holding company’s subsidiary banks or by
others—that a bank subsidiary has discounted or that any
subsidiary of the holding company has purchased.
(1) Acceptances executed by a subsidiary bank of the
reporting holding company. With the exceptions
described below, the reporting holding company
must report on its balance sheet the full amount of the
acceptance in both (a) the liability item, ‘‘Other
liabilities’’ (Schedule HC, item 20), reﬂecting the
subsidiary bank’s obligation to put the holder of the
acceptance in funds at maturity, and (b) the asset
item, ‘‘Other assets’’ (Schedule HC, item 11),
reﬂecting the account party’s liability to put the
accepting bank subsidiary in funds at or before
maturity. The acceptance liability and acceptance
asset must also be reported in both Schedule HC-G,
item 4, “Other liabilities,” and Schedule HC-F,
item 6, “Other assets,” respectively.
Exceptions to the mandatory reporting by the report-
ing holding company of the full amount of all
outstanding drafts accepted by the bank subsidi-
ary(ies) of the reporting holding company in both
‘‘Other liabilities’’ (Schedule HC, item 20) and
‘‘Other assets’’ (Schedule HC, item 11) on the Con-
solidated Balance sheet of the FR Y-9C occur in the
following situations:
(a) One exception occurs in situations where the
accepting bank acquires—through initial dis-
counting or subsequent purchase—and holds its
own acceptance (i.e., a draft that it has itself
accepted). In this case, the bank subsidiary’s own
acceptances that are held by it will not be reported
in the ‘‘Other liabilities’’ and ‘‘Other assets’’
items noted above. The bank subsidiary’s hold-
ings of its own acceptances will be reported
either in “Loans and leases held for sale” (Sched-
ule HC, item 4.a), “Loans and leases, held for
investment (Schedule HC, item 4(b)) or, if held
in a trading account, in ‘‘Trading assets’’ (Sched-
ule HC, item 5).
(b) A second exception occurs where the parent
holding company or a subsidiary of the holding
company (other than the accepting bank subsidi-
ary) purchases an acceptance executed by one of
the reporting holding company’s subsidiary banks.
In this case, the process of consolidation elimi-
nates the consolidated holding company’s liabil-
ity on acceptances and outstanding and the cus-
tomers’ liability to the accepting bank on
acceptances outstanding will be reported either in
Schedule HC, item 4(b) or item 5.
(c) A third exception occurs in situations where the
account party anticipates its liability to a bank
subsidiary of the reporting holding company on
an acceptance outstanding by making a payment
to the bank that reduces the customer’s liability
in advance of the maturity of the acceptance. In
this case, the holding company will decrease the
asset item “Other assets” (Schedule HC, item 11)
by the amount of such prepayment; the prepay-
ment will not affect the liability item “Other
liabilities” (Schedule HC, item 20) which would
continue to reﬂect the full amount of the accep-
tance until the bank subsidiary has repaid the
holder of the acceptance at the maturity date
speciﬁed in the instrument. If the account party’s
payment to the accepting bank before the matu-
rity date is not for the purpose of immediate
reduction of its indebtedness to the reporting
bank or if receipt of the payment does not
immediately reduce or extinguish that indebted-
ness, such advance payment will not reduce
item 11 of Schedule HC but should be reﬂected
in the bank’s deposit liabilities.
(d) A fourth exception occurs when the holding
company has a subsidiary of the holding com-
pany (other than the accepting bank) that is the
account party (customer) in the acceptance trans-
action. In this case, the process of consolidation
eliminates the asset item but will leave the liabil-
ity item (item 20) unaffected except where the
holding company or one of its consolidated sub-
sidiaries purchases the acceptance executed.
In all situations other than these two exceptions just
described, the reporting holding company’s ﬁnancial
statement must reﬂect the full amount of its accep-
tances in ‘‘Other liabilities’’ (Schedule HC, item 20)
and in “Other assets” (Schedule HC, item 11).
(2) “Participations” in acceptances. The general require-
ment for the accepting bank to report on its balance
sheet the full amount of the total obligation to put the
holder of the acceptance in funds applies also, in
Glossary

particular, to any situation in which the accept-
ingbank enters into any kind of arrangement with
others for the purpose of having the latter share, or
participate, in the obligation to put the holder of the
acceptance in funds at maturity or in the risk of loss
in the event of default on the part of the account
party.3 In any such sharing arrangement or participa-
tion agreement—regardless of its form or its contract
provisions, regardless of the terminology (e.g.,
‘‘funded,’’ ‘‘risk,’’ ‘‘unconditional,’’ or ‘‘contingent’’)
used to describe it and the relationships under it,
regardless of whether it is described as a participation
in the customer’s liability or in the accepting bank’s
obligation or in the risk of default by the account
party, and regardless of the system of debits and
credits used by the accepting bank to reﬂect the
participation arrangement—the existence of the par-
ticipation or other agreement does not reduce the
accepting bank’s obligation to honor the full amount
of the acceptance at maturity.
The existence of such participations is not to be
recorded on the balance sheet of the accepting bank
subsidiary nor on the consolidated balance sheet
(Schedule HC) of the holding company (except for
immaterial amounts) that conveys shares in its obli-
gation to put the holder of the acceptance in funds or
shares in its risk of loss in the event of default on the
part of the account party, and similarly is not to be
recorded on the balance sheets (Schedule HC) of the
other holding companies or their subsidiaries that are
party to, or acquire, such participations. However, in
such cases of agreements to participate, the nonac-
cepting institution acquiring the participation will
report the participation in HC-R, Part II item 17 ‘‘All
other off-balance sheet liabilities.’’ This same report-
ing treatment applies to a holding company that
acquires a participation in an acceptance of another
(accepting) institution and subsequently conveys the
participation to others and to an institution that
acquires such a participation. Moreover, the holding
company that both acquires and conveys a participa-
tion in another institution’s acceptance must report
the amount of the ‘‘All other off-balance sheet liabi-
lites’’ item in Schedule HC-R, Part II.
(3) Acceptances owned by the reporting holding com-
pany. The treatment of acceptances owned or held by
the reporting holding company (whether acquired by
initial discount or subsequent purchase) depends
upon whether the acceptances are held in trading
account or in portfolio and upon whether the accep-
tances held have been accepted by a bank subsidiary
of the reporting holding company or by a bank that is
not a subsidiary of the reporting holding company.
All acceptances held by the reporting holding com-
pany in trading accounts (whether acceptances of a
bank of the reporting holding company or of banks
outside the holding company) are to be reported in
Schedule HC, item 5, ‘‘Trading assets.’’ Holding
companies that must complete Schedule HC-D, Trad-
ing Assets and Liabilities, will identify there hold-
ings in item 9, ‘‘Other trading assets.’’ The reporting
holding company’s holdings of acceptances other
than those in its trading account (whether accep-
tances of a bank subsidiary of the reporting holding
company or of banks outside the holding company)
are to be reported in Schedule HC, item 4.a, “Loans
and leases held for sale,” or in item 4(b), “Loans and
leases, held for investment,” and in Schedule HC-C
which calls for detail on “Loans and lease ﬁnancing
receivables.”
In Schedule HC-C, Part I, the reporting holding com-
pany’s holdings of acceptances of banks outside the
reporting holding company, other than those held in trad-
ing accounts, are to be reported in ‘‘Loans to depository
institutions and acceptances of other banks’’ (item 2). On
the other hand, the holding company’s holdings of accep-
tances of its bank subsidiaries, other than those held in
trading accounts, are to be reported in Schedule HC-C
according to the account party of the draft. Thus, hold-
ings of acceptances of bank subsidiaries for which the
account parties are commercial or industrial enterprises
are to be reported in Schedule HC-C in ‘‘Commercial and
industrial loans’’ (item 4); holdings of acceptances of
subsidiary banks for which the account parties are banks
outside the holding company (e.g., in connection with the
reﬁnancing of another acceptance or for the ﬁnancing of
dollar exchange) are to be reported in Schedule HC-C in
‘‘Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of
other banks’’ (item 2); and holdings of acceptances of
subsidiary banks for which the account parties are for-
eign governments or official institutions (e.g., for the
ﬁnancing of dollar exchange) are to be reported in
3. The discussion does not deal with participations in holdings of
bankers acceptances, which are reportable under loans. Such participations
are treated like any participations in loans.

Schedule HC-C, ‘‘Loans to foreign governments and
official institutions’’ (item 7).
The difference in treatment between holdings of accep-
tances of subsidiary banks and holdings of other banks’
acceptances reﬂects the fact that, for other banks’ accep-
tances, the holding company’s immediate claim is on the
accepting bank, regardless of the account party or of the
purpose of the loan. On the other hand, for its holdings of
its own acceptances, the holding company’s immediate
claim is on the account party named in the accepted draft.
If the account party prepays its acceptance liability on an
acceptance of a bank subsidiary of the reporting holding
company that is held by the bank subsidiary (either in
loans or trading account) so as to immediately reduce its
indebtedness to the bank subsidiary, the recording of the
holding—in ‘‘Commercial and industrial loans,’’ ‘‘Loans
to depository institutions,’’ or ‘‘Assets held in trading
accounts,’’ as appropriate—is reduced by the prepay-
ment.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance: ASC Subtopic 325-30,
Investments—Other—Investments in Insurance Con-
tracts, addresses the accounting for bank-owned life
insurance. According to ASC Subtopic 325-30, only the
amount that could be realized under the insurance con-
tract as of the balance sheet date should be reported as an
asset. In general, this amount is the cash surrender value
reported to the institution by the insurance carrier less
any applicable surrender charges not reﬂected by the
insurance carrier in the reported cash surrender value,
i.e., the net cash surrender value. An institution should
also consider any additional amounts included in the
contractual terms of the policy in determining the amount
that could be realized under the insurance contract in
accordance with ASC Subtopic 325-30.
Because there is no right of offset, an investment in
bank-owned life insurance should be reported as an asset
separately from any related deferred compensation liabil-
ity.
Institutions that have entered into split-dollar life insur-
ance arrangements should follow the guidance on the
accounting for the deferred compensation and postretire-
ment beneﬁt aspects of such arrangements in ASC Sub-
topic 715-60, Compensation-Retirement Beneﬁts—
Deﬁned Beneﬁt Plans-Other Postretirement. In general,
in an endorsement split-dollar arrangement, an institution
owns and controls the insurance policy on the employee,
whereas in a collateral assignment split-dollar arrange-
ment, the employee owns and controls the insurance
policy. According to ASC Subtopic 715-60, an institution
should recognize a liability for the postretirement beneﬁt
related to a split-dollar life insurance arrangement if,
based on the substantive agreement with the employee,
the institution has agreed to maintain a life insurance
policy during the employee’s retirement or provide the
employee with a death beneﬁt. This liability should be
measured in accordance with either ASC Topic 715,
Compensation-Retirement Beneﬁts (if, in substance, a
postretirement
beneﬁt
plan
exists)
or
ASC
Subtopic 710-10, Compensation-General—Overall, (if
the arrangement is, in substance, an individual deferred
compensation contract), and reported on the balance
sheet in Schedule HC, item 20, “Other liabilities,” and in
Schedule HC-G, item 4, “Other.” In addition, for a
collateral assignment split-dollar arrangement, ASC Sub-
topic 715-60 states that an employer such as an institu-
tion should recognize and measure an insurance asset
based on the nature and substance of the arrangement.
The amount that could be realized under bank-owned life
insurance policies as of the report date should be reported
on the balance sheet in Schedule HC, item 11, ‘‘Other
assets,’’ and in Schedule HC-F, item 5, ‘‘Life insurance
assets.’’ The net earnings (losses) on or the net increases
(decreases) in the institution’s life insurance assets should
be reported in the income statement in Schedule HI, item
5(l), ‘‘Other noninterest income.’’ Alternatively, the gross
earnings (losses) on or increases (decreases) in these life
insurance assets may be reported in Schedule HI, item
5(l), and the life insurance policy expenses may be
reported in Schedule HI, item 7(d), ‘‘Other noninterest
expense.’’ If the absolute value of the earnings (losses) on
or the increases (decreases) in the institution’s life insur-
ance assets are reported in Schedule HI, item 5(l), “Other
noninterest income,” are greater than $100,000 and
exceed 7 percent of ‘‘Other noninterest income,’’ this
amount should be reported in Schedule HI, Memoran-
dum item 6(b).
Banks, U.S. and Foreign: In the classiﬁcation of banks
as customers of the reporting holding company, distinc-
tions are drawn for purposes of the FR Y-9C between
“U.S. banks” and “commercial banks in the U.S.” and
between “foreign banks” and “banks in foreign coun-
tries.” Some report items call for one set of these
categories and other items call for the other set. The
distinctions center around the inclusion or exclusion of

foreign branches of U.S. banks and U.S. branches and
agencies of foreign banks. For purposes of describing the
office location of banks as customers of the reporting
bank, the term “United States” covers the 50 states of the
United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and
U.S. territories and possessions. (This is in contrast to the
usage with respect to the offices of the reporting bank,
where U.S.-domiciled Edge and Agreement subsidiaries
and IBFs are included in “foreign” offices. Furthermore,
for holding companies chartered and headquartered in the
50 states of the United States and the District of Colum-
bia, offices of the reporting holding company in Puerto
Rico and U.S. territories and possessions are also included
in “foreign” offices, but, for holding companies chartered
and headquartered in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and
possessions, offices of the reporting holding company in
Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions are
included in “domestic” offices.)
U.S. banks—The term ‘‘U.S. banks’’ covers both the U.S.
and foreign branches of banks chartered and head-
quartered in the U.S. (including U.S.-chartered banks
owned by foreigners), but excluding U.S. branches and
agencies of foreign banks. On the other hand, the term
‘‘banks in the U.S.’’ or ‘‘commercial banks in the U.S.’’
(the institutional coverage of which is described in detail
later in this entry) covers the U.S. offices of U.S. banks
(including their IBFs) and the U.S. branches and agencies
of foreign banks, but excludes the foreign branches of
U.S. banks.
Foreign banks—Similarly, the term ‘‘foreign banks’’
covers all branches of banks chartered and headquartered
in foreign countries (including foreign banks owned by
U.S. nationals and institutions), including their U.S.-
domiciled branches and agencies, but excluding the
foreign branches of U.S. banks. In contrast, the term
‘‘banks in foreign countries’’ covers foreign-domiciled
branches of banks, including the foreign branches of U.S.
banks, but excluding the U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks.

ries of banks considered as customers as used in the

U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks—U.S.
branches of foreign banks include any offices or places of

Borrowings and Deposits in Foreign Offices: Bor-
row ings in foreign offices include assets rediscounted
with central banks, certain participations sold in loans
and securities, government funding of loans, borrowings
from the Export–Import Bank, and rediscounted trade
acceptances. Federal funds sold and repurchase agree-
ments in foreign offices should be reported in accordance
with the Glossary entries for “Federal Funds Transac-
tions” and “Repurchase/Resale Agreements.” Liability
accounts such as accruals and allocated capital shall not
be reported as borrowings. Deposits consist of such other
short-term and long-term liabilities issued or undertaken
as a means of obtaining funds to be used in the banking
business and include those liabilities generally character-
ized as placements and takings, call money, and deposit
substitutes. Key factors in determining if a liability is a
deposit or borrowing are the provisions of the underlying
contract. If no such contract exists the conﬁrmation may
be used to determine the nature of the liability.
Brokered Deposits: Brokered deposits represent depos-
its which the banking subsidiaries of the reporting hold-
ing company obtain, directly or indirectly, from or
through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker as
deﬁned under Section 337.6(a) of the FDIC’s regulations.
Brokered deposits include both those in which the entire
beneﬁcial interest in a given bank deposit account or
instrument issued by the bank subsidiary is held by a
single depositor and those in which the broker sells
participations in a given bank deposit account or instru-
ment to one or more investors.
The meaning of the term “brokered deposit” depends on
the meaning of the term “deposit broker.” The term
deposit broker is deﬁned in Section 29(g) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act and Section 337.6(a)(5) of the
FDIC’s regulations. Under Section 337.6(a)(5), the term
“deposit broker” means:
• Any person engaged in the business of placing deposits
of third parties with insured depository institutions;
• Any person engaged in the business of facilitating the
placement of deposits of third parties with insured
depository institutions;
• Any person engaged in the business of placing deposits
with insured depository institutions for the purpose of
selling those deposits or interests in those deposits to
third parties, and
• An agent or trustee who establishes a deposit account
to facilitate a business arrangement with an insured
depository institution to use the proceeds of the account
to fund a prearranged loan.
The FDIC’s regulations under Section 337.6(a)(5) further
provide that a person is: (1) “Engaged in the business of
placing deposits” of third parties if that person receives
third party funds and deposits those funds at more than
one insured depository institution; and (2) “Engaged in
the business of facilitating the placement of deposits” of
third parties by, while engaged in business, with respect
to deposits placed at more than one insured depository
institution, engaging in one or more of the following
activities:
• The person has legal authority, contractual or other-
wise, to close the account or move the third party’s
funds to another insured depository institution;
Glossary

• The person is involved in negotiating or setting rates,
fees, terms, or conditions for the deposit account; or
• The person engages in matchmaking activities, which
occurs if the person proposes deposit allocations at, or
between, more than one bank based upon both the
particular deposit objectives of a speciﬁc depositor or
depositor’s agent, and the particular deposit objectives
of speciﬁc banks, except in the case of deposits placed
by a depositor’s agent with a bank affiliated with the
depositor’s agent. A proposed deposit allocation is
based on the particular objectives of:
(i) A depositor or depositor’s agent when the
person has access to speciﬁc ﬁnancial infor-
mation of the depositor or depositor’s agent
and the proposed deposit allocation is based
upon such information; and
(ii) A bank when the person has access to the
target deposit-balance objectives of speciﬁc
banks and the proposed deposit allocation is
based upon such information.
Brokered CDs that are placed by or through the assis-
tance of third parties with insured depository institutions
are brokered deposits. Section 337.6(a)(5)(v)(I)(4) deﬁnes
brokered CD as a deposit placement arrangement in
which a master certiﬁcate of deposit is issued by an
insured depository institution in the name of the third
party that has organized the funding of the certiﬁcate of
deposit, or in the name of a custodian or a sub-custodian
of the third party, and the certiﬁcate is funded by
individual investors through the third party, with each
individual investor receiving an ownership interest in the
certiﬁcate of deposit, or a similar deposit placement
arrangement that the FDIC determines is arranged for a
similar purpose.
Section 337.6(a)(5) also provides that the term deposit
broker does not include:
(1) an insured depository institution, with respect to
funds placed with that depository institution;
(2) an employee of an insured depository institution,
with respect to funds placed with the employing
depository institution;
(3) a trust department of an insured depository institu-
tion, if the trust or other ﬁduciary relationship in
question has not been established for the primary
purpose of placing funds with insured depository
institutions;
(4) the trustee of a pension or other employee beneﬁt
plan, with respect to funds of the plan;
(5) a person acting as a plan administrator or an
investment adviser in connection with a pension
plan or other employee beneﬁt plan provided that
that person is performing managerial functions with
respect to the plan;
(6) the trustee of a testamentary account;
(7) the trustee of an irrevocable trust (other than a
trustee who establishes a deposit account to facili-
tate a business arrangement with an insured deposi-
tory institution to use the proceeds of the account to
fund a prearranged loan), as long as the trust in
question has not been established for the primary
purpose of placing funds with insured depository
institutions;
(8) a trustee or custodian of a pension or proﬁt sharing
plan qualiﬁed under Section 401(d) or 430(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
(9) an agent or nominee whose primary purpose is not
the placement of funds with depository institutions;
or
(10) an insured depository institution acting as an inter-
mediary or agent of a U.S. government department
or agency for a government sponsored minority or
women-owned depository institution deposit pro-
gram.
Section 337.6(a)(5) describes what it means to be “an
agent or nominee whose primary purpose is not the
placement of funds with depository institutions.” More
speciﬁcally, the primary purpose exception applies when
the primary purpose of the agent’s or nominee’s business
relationship with its customers is not the placement of
funds with depository institutions.
The following business relationships are designated in
Section 337.6(a)(5)(I)(1)(i) through (xiv) as meeting the
primary purpose exception, subject to applicable notice
and
reporting
requirements
set
forth
in
Sec-
tion 303.243(b)(3), where, with respect to a particular

• The agent or nominee places, or assists in placing,
customer funds into deposit accounts for the primary
purpose of posting collateral for customers to secure

• The agent or nominee places, or assists in placing,
customer funds into deposit accounts for the primary
purpose of paying for or reimbursing qualiﬁed medical

customer funds into deposit accounts to enable partici-
pation in the following tax-advantaged programs: indi-

• The FDIC has speciﬁcally identiﬁed the following
additional business relationship as meeting the primary
purpose exception: The agent or nominee places, or
assists in placing, customer funds at insured depository
institutions, in a custodial capacity, based upon instruc-
tions received from a depositor or depositor’s agent
speciﬁc to each insured depository institution and
deposit account, and the agent or nominee neither plays
any role in determining at which insured depository
institution(s) to place any customers’ funds, nor nego-
tiates or sets rates, terms, fees, or conditions, for the
deposit account.
- A custodial agent that plays any role in determining
at which IDI(s) to place any customers’ funds will
not be eligible for this designated exception. As an
example, a custodial agent that plays any role in
creating, operating, or using an algorithm that is used
to determine or recommend at which IDI(s) any
customer funds are placed would be viewed as
playing a role in determining at which banks the
depositor’s funds are to be placed and thus not
eligible for the designated exception.
- The involvement of the non-discretionary custodial
agent does not change the classiﬁcation of deposits
placed by, or through the facilitation of, an entity that
otherwise meets the deposit broker deﬁnition.
An agent or nominee that does not rely on a designated
business exception described above must receive an
approval
under
the
application
process
in

purpose exception to the deposit broker deﬁnition. For

An insured depository institution that receives deposits
from an entity with a primary purpose exception (e.g.,
sweep deposits received from an unaffiliated broker-
dealer) should be aware whether there are any additional
third parties involved in the deposit placement arrange-
ment, and if so, must determine whether that third party
qualiﬁes as a deposit broker. Although an entity with a
primary purpose exception that otherwise meets the
deposit broker deﬁnition is not a deposit broker under
12 CFR 337.6(a)(5)(v)(I), a brokered deposit is any
deposit that is obtained, directly or indirectly, from or
through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker
under 12 CFR 337.6(a)(2). Therefore, an insured deposi-
tory institution that receives deposits from an entity with
a primary purpose exception must report the deposits as
brokered if an additional third party that qualiﬁes as a
deposit broker is involved (e.g., a third party engaged in
matchmaking
activities
as
described
in
12
CFR
337.6(a)(5)(iii)(C)).
In some cases, brokered deposits are issued in the name
of the depositor whose funds have been placed in a
holding company or its subsidiary by a deposit broker. In
other cases, a holding company’s deposit account records
may indicate that the funds have been deposited in the
name of a third-party custodian for the beneﬁt of others
(e.g., “XYZ Corporation as custodian for the beneﬁt of
others,” or “Custodial account of XYZ Corporation”).
Unless the custodian meets one of the speciﬁc exemp-
tions from the “deposit broker” deﬁnition in Section 29
of
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Act
and
Sec-
tion 337.6(a) of the FDIC’s regulations, these custodial
accounts should be reported as brokered deposits in
Schedule HC-E, Deposit Liabilities.
Section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief,
and Consumer Protection Act, enacted on May 24, 2018,
amends Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
to except a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from
treatment as, and from being reported as, brokered
deposits for qualifying institutions. The FDIC has
amended its regulations to conform to the treatment of
reciprocal deposits set forth in Section 202. As deﬁned in
Section 337.7(e)(2)(v) “reciprocal deposits” means
“deposits received by an agent institution through a
deposit placement network with the same maturity (if
any) and in the same aggregate amount as covered
deposits placed by the agent institution in other network
member banks.”
As deﬁned in Section 327.8(q) of the FDIC’s regulations,
“brokered reciprocal deposits” are “reciprocal deposits as
deﬁned in Section 337.6(e)(2)(v) of the FDIC’s regula-
tion that are not excepted from an institutions brokered
deposits pursuant to Section 337.6(e)” of the FDIC’s
regulations. Brokered reciprocal deposits should be
reported as brokered deposits in Schedule HC-E, Memo-
randum items 1 and 2.
Brokered Retail Deposits: are brokered deposits that are
issued in denominations of $250,000 or less or that are
issued in denominations greater than $250,000 and par-
ticipated out by the broker in shares of $250,000 or less.
In some cases, brokered certiﬁcates of deposits are issued
in $1,000 amounts under a master certiﬁcate of deposit
issued by a bank subsidiary to a deposit broker in an
amount that exceeds $250,000. For these retail brokered
deposits, multiple purchases by individual depositors
from an individual bank subsidiary normally do not
exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit (currently
$250,000), but under current deposit insurance rules the
deposit broker is not required to provide information
routinely on these purchasers and their account owner-
ship capacity to the bank subsidiary issuing the deposits.
If this information is not readily available to the issuing
bank subsidiary, these brokered certiﬁcates of deposit in
$1,000 amounts may be rebuttably presumed to be fully
insured brokered deposits and should be reported in
Schedule HC-E, Memorandum item 1 or 2. In addition,
some brokered deposits are transaction accounts or
money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) that are
denominated in amounts of $0.01 and established and
maintained by the deposit broker (or its agent) as agent,
custodian, or other ﬁduciary for the broker’s customers.
An individual depositor’s deposits within the brokered
transaction account or MMDA normally do not exceed
the applicable deposit insurance limit. As with retail
brokered deposits, if information on these depositors and
their account ownership capacity is not readily available
to the bank subsidiary establishing the transaction account
or MMDA, the amounts in the transaction account or
MMDA may be rebuttably presumed to be fully insured
brokered deposits and should be reported in Sched-
ule HC-E, Memorandum item 1 or 2.
Broker’s Security Draft: A broker’s security draft is a
draft with securities or title to securities attached that is
drawn to obtain payment for the securities. This draft is
sent to a bank for collection with instructions to release
the securities only on payment of the draft.

Business Combinations: The accounting and reporting
standards for business combinations are set forth in ASC
Topic 805, Business Combinations. ASC Topic 805
requires that all business combinations, which are deﬁned
as the acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities
that constitute a business, be accounted for using the
acquisition method of accounting. The formation of a
joint venture, the acquisition of a group of assets that do
not constitute a business, and a transfer of net assets or
exchange of equity interests between entities under com-
mon control are not considered business combinations
and therefore are not accounted for using the acquisition
method of accounting.
Acquisition method −Under the acquisition method, the
acquirer in a business combination shall measure the
identiﬁable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and
any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their
acquisition-date fair values (with limited exceptions
speciﬁed in ASC Topic 805) using the deﬁnition of fair
value in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures. The acquisition date is generally the date on
which the acquirer legally transfers the consideration,
acquires the assets, and assumes the liabilities of the
acquiree, i.e., the closing date. ASC Topic 805 requires
the acquirer to measure acquired receivables, including
loans, at their acquisition-date fair values.
A holding company is required to determine whether any
acquired ﬁnancial assets meet the deﬁnition of a pur-
chased credit-deteriorated (PCD) asset. For a ﬁnancial
asset that meets the deﬁnition of a PCD asset, the holding
company applies the gross-up approach and records the
acquired ﬁnancial asset at its purchase price plus
acquisition-date allowance for credit losses, which estab-
lishes the initial amortized cost basis of the PCD asset.
For acquired ﬁnancial assets that are not PCD assets, the
acquirer records the purchased ﬁnancial assets at their
acquisition-date fair values. Additionally, for those
acquired ﬁnancial assets within the scope of ASC Sub-
topic 326-20 that are not PCD ﬁnancial assets, an allow-
ance is initially recorded with a corresponding charge to
the provision for credit losses expense in the reporting
period that includes the acquisition date. See also the
Glossary entries for “Allowance for Credit Losses” and
“Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Assets.”
The consideration transferred in a business combination
shall be calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair
values. Acquisition-related costs are costs the acquirer
incurs to effect a business combination such as ﬁnder’s
fees; advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other
professional or consulting fees; and general administra-
tive costs. The acquirer shall account for acquisition-
related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs
are incurred and the services received. The cost to
register and issue debt or equity securities shall be
recognized in accordance with other applicable generally
accepted accounting principles.
At the acquisition date, an acquirer generally will not
have obtained all of the information necessary to measure
the fair values of the identiﬁable assets acquired, liabili-
ties assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree,
and consideration transferred for the acquiree. Under
ASC Topic 805, if the initial accounting for a business
combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting
period in which the combination occurs, the acquirer
should report provisional amounts in its FR Y-9C for the
items for which the accounting is incomplete. Provisional
amounts should be based on the best information avail-
able. During the measurement period, the acquirer is
required to adjust the provisional amounts recognized at
the acquisition date, with a corresponding adjustment to
goodwill, to reﬂect new information obtained about facts
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date
that, if known, would have affected the measurement of
the amounts recognized as of that date. Topic 805 further
requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provi-
sional amounts identiﬁed during the measurement period
in the reporting period in which adjustment amounts are
determined. The acquirer also must recognize in the
income statement for the same reporting period the effect
on earnings, if any, resulting from the adjustments to the
provisional amounts as if the accounting for the business
combination had been completed as of the acquisition
date. See ASC Topic 805 for additional guidance on the
measurement period and adjustments to provisional
amounts during this period.
ASC Topic 805 provides guidance for recognizing par-
ticular assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquired
assets may be tangible (such as securities or ﬁxed assets)
or intangible (as discussed in the following paragraph).
An acquiring entity must not recognize the goodwill, if
any, or the deferred income taxes recorded by an acquired
entity before its acquisition. However, a deferred tax
liability or asset must be recognized for differences
between the assigned values and the tax bases of the
recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a

business combination in accordance with ASC Topic
740, Income Taxes. (For further information, see the
Glossary entry for “Income Taxes.”)
Under ASC Topic 805, an intangible asset must be
recognized as an asset separately from goodwill if it
arises from contractual or other legal rights (regardless of
transferability or separability). Otherwise, an intangible
asset must be recognized as an asset separately from
goodwill only if it is separable, that is, it is capable of
being separated or divided from the entity and sold,
transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged either indi-
vidually or together with a related contract, identiﬁable
asset, or liability. Examples of intangible assets that must
be recognized as an asset separately from goodwill are
core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relation-
ships, servicing assets, favorable leasehold rights, trade-
marks, trade names, internet domain names, and noncom-
petition agreements. However, a holding company that is
a private company, as deﬁned in U.S. GAAP, may elect
the private company accounting alternative for the recog-
nition of certain identiﬁable intangible assets acquired in
a business combination provided by ASC Subtopic 805-
20, Business Combinations – Identiﬁable Assets and
Liabilities, and Any Noncontrolling Interest, if it also has
adopted the private company goodwill accounting alter-
native provided by ASC Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles –
Goodwill and Other – Goodwill. Intangible assets that
are recognized separately from goodwill must be reported
in Schedule HC, item 10(b), “Other intangible assets,”
and in Schedule HC-M, item 12. Refer to the Glossary
entry for “goodwill” for further information on the
private company accounting alternative for identiﬁable
intangible assets. See also the Glossary entries for “Pri-
vate Company” and “Public Business Entity.”
In general, the excess of the sum of the consideration
transferred in a business combination plus the fair value
of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree over the net
of the acquisition-date amounts of the identiﬁable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accor-
dance with ASC Topic 805 must be recognized as
goodwill, which is reported in Schedule HC, item 10(a).
An acquired intangible asset that does not meet the
criteria described in the preceding paragraph must be
included in the amount recognized as goodwill. After
initial recognition, goodwill must be accounted for in
accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill
and Other, and the instructions for Schedule HI,
item 7.c.(1), “Goodwill impairment losses.”
In contrast, if the total acquisition-date amount of the
identiﬁable net assets acquired exceeds the consideration
transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree (i.e., a bargain purchase), the
acquirer shall reassess whether it has correctly identiﬁed
all of the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed
and shall recognize any additional assets or liabilities that
are identiﬁed in that review. If that excess remains after
the review, the acquirer shall recognize that excess in
earnings as a gain attributable to the acquirer on the
acquisition date and report the amount in Schedule HI,
item 5(l), “Other noninterest income.”
Under the acquisition method, the historical equity capi-
tal balances of the acquired business are not to be carried
forward to the balance sheet of the combined holding
company. The operating results of the acquired business
are to be included in the income and expenses of the
reporting holding company only from the acquisition
date.
Pooling-of-interests method – Under the pooling-of-
interests method, the assets, liabilities, and capital of the
holding company and the business being acquired are
added together on a line-by-line basis without any adjust-
ments for fair value. The historical cost-based amount
(cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and dis-
counts or depreciation) of each asset, liability, and capital
account of the acquiring holding company is added to the
corresponding account of the business being acquired to
arrive at the balance sheet for the combined holding
company. However, the capital stock outstanding of the
combined holding company must be equal to the number
of shares issued and outstanding (including the shares
issued in connection with the acquisition) multiplied by
par or stated value.
If the sum of the capital stock accounts of the entities
being combined does not equal this amount (and it rarely,
if ever, will), adjustment is required. If the sum of the
capital stock accounts is less than the number of shares
outstanding of the combined holding company multiplied
by par or stated value, “Surplus,” Schedule HC, item 25,
must be debited for the amount of the difference and
“Common stock,” Schedule HC, item 24, is credited. If
the surplus account is insufficient to absorb such an
adjustment, the remainder must be debited to “Retained
earnings,” Schedule HC, item 26(a). If the sum of the
capital stock accounts is more than the amount of the
Glossary
GL-18
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2024

outstanding stock of the combined bank, “Surplus” must
be credited and “Common stock” debited.
Any adjustments necessary to conform the accounting
methods of the acquired entity to those of the reporting
holding company must be made, net of related tax effects,
to “Retained earnings.”
For the year in which a pooling of interests occurs,
income and expenses must be reported in Schedule HI,
Income Statement, as though the companies had com-
bined at the beginning of the year. The portion of the
adjustment necessary to conform the accounting methods
applicable to the current period must also be allocated to
income and expenses for the period.
Transactions between entities under common control – A
transaction in which net assets or equity interests (e.g.,
voting shares) that constitute a business are transferred
between entities under common control is not accounted
for as a business combination. The method used to
account for such transactions is similar to the pooling-of-
interests method. In accordance with ASC Subtopic
805-50, when applying a method similar to the pooling-
of-interests method to a transfer of net assets or an
exchange of equity interests between entities under com-
mon control, the entity that receives the net assets or
equity interests shall initially measure the recognized
assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts
in the accounts of the transferring entity at the date of
transfer. If the carrying amounts of the assets and liabili-
ties transferred differ from the historical cost of the
parent of the entities under common control, for example,
because pushdown accounting had not been applied, then
the ﬁnancial statements of the receiving entity shall
reﬂect the transferred assets and liabilities at the histori-
cal cost of the parent of the entities under common
control. Consequently, and without regard to the push-
down accounting election made by the acquiree, if a
parent transfers the acquiree to another entity under
common control or merges the acquiree with another
entity under common control, the receiving entity accounts
for the acquiree using the parent’s historical cost for the
net assets or equity interests in the acquiree. The parent’s
historical cost includes the values of the acquiree’s assets
(including goodwill) and liabilities that were remeasured
at fair value on the acquisition date of the business
combination. If there has been a change in reporting
entity as deﬁned by ASC Subtopic 250-10, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections–Overall, for the year in
which a transaction between entities under common
control occurs, income and expenses must be reported in
Schedule HI, Income Statement, as though the entities
had combined at the beginning of the year. The portion of
the adjustment necessary to conform the accounting
methods applicable to the current period must also be
allocated to income and expense for the period.
Call Option: See ‘‘Derivative Contracts.”
Capital Contributions of Cash and Notes Receivable:
An institution may receive cash or a note receivable as a
contribution to its equity capital. The transaction may be
a sale of capital stock or a contribution to paid-in capital
(surplus), both of which are referred to hereafter as
capital contributions. The accounting for capital contribu-
tions in the form of notes receivable is set forth in ASC
Subtopic 505-10, Equity—Overall and SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (Topic 4.E., Receivables
from Sale of Stock, in the Codiﬁcation of Staff Account-
ing Bulletins). This Glossary entry does not address other
forms of contributions, for example, nonmonetary contri-
butions to equity capital such as a building, or grants
received and recorded in accordance with ASC Sub-
topic 958-605, Not-For-Proﬁt Entities, as applicable.4
A capital contribution of cash should be recorded in an
institution’s ﬁnancial statements when received. There-
fore, a capital contribution of cash prior to a quarter-end
report date should be reported as an increase in equity
capital in the institution’s reports for that quarter (in
Schedule HI-A, item 5 or 11, as appropriate). A contribu-
tion of cash after quarter-end should not be reﬂected as
an increase in the equity capital of an earlier reporting
period.
When an institution receives a note receivable rather than
cash as a capital contribution, ASC Subtopic 505-10
states that it is generally not appropriate to report the note
as an asset. As a consequence, the predominant practice
is to offset the note and the capital contribution in the
equity capital section of the balance sheet, i.e., the note
receivable is reported as a reduction of equity capital. In
this situation, the capital stock issued or the contribution
to paid-in capital should be reported in Schedule HC,
4. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 958-605, not-for-proﬁt and busi-
ness entities would report contributions received as revenue (i.e., income).
Although the scope of ASC Subtopic 958-605 excludes contributions made
by governmental entities to business (for-proﬁt) entities, including deposi-
tory institutions, entities scoped out of ASC Subtopic 958-605 are not
precluded from applying it by analogy when appropriate.

item 23, 24, or 25, as appropriate, and the note receivable
should be reported as a deduction from equity capital in
Schedule HC, item 26.c, ‘‘Other equity capital compo-
nents.’’ No net increase in equity capital should be
reported in Schedule HI-A, Changes in Holding Com-
pany Equity Capital. In addition, when a note receivable
is offset in the equity capital section of the balance sheet,
accrued interest receivable on the note also should be
offset in equity (and reported as a deduction from equity
capital in Schedule HC, item 26.c), consistent with the
guidance in ASC Subtopic 505-10. Because a nonrecip-
rocal transfer from an owner or another party to an
institution does not typically result in the recognition of
income or expense, the accrual of interest on a note
receivable that has been reported as a deduction from
equity capital should be reported as additional paid-in
capital rather than interest income.
However, ASC Subtopic 505-10 provides that an institu-
tion may record a note received as a capital contribution
as an asset, rather than a reduction of equity capital, only
if the note is collected in cash ‘‘before the ﬁnancial
statements are issued.’’ The note receivable must also
satisfy the existence criteria described below, along with
any applicable laws and regulations. When these condi-
tions are met, the note receivable should be reported
separately from an institution’s other loans and receiv-
ables in Schedule HC-F, item 6, ‘‘All other assets,’’ and
individually itemized and described in accordance with
the instructions for item 6, if appropriate.
For purposes of this report, the ﬁnancial statements are
considered issued at the earliest of the following dates:
(1) The submission deadline for the FR Y-9C report;
(2) Any other public ﬁnancial statement ﬁling deadline
to which the institution is subject; or
(3) The note must be executed and enforceable before
quarter-end.
To be reported as an asset, rather than a reduction of
equity capital, as of a quarter-end report date, a note
received as a capital contribution (that is collected in cash
as described above) must meet the deﬁnition of an asset
under generally accepted accounting principles by satis-
fying all of the following existence criteria:
(1) There must be written documentation providing evi-
dence that the note was contributed to the institution
prior to the quarter-end report date by those with
authority to make such a capital contribution on
behalf of the issuer of the note (e.g., if the contribu-
tion is by the institution’s parent holding company,
those in authority would be the holding company’s
board of directors or its chief executive officer or
chief ﬁnancial officer);
(2) The note must be a legally binding obligation of the
issuer to fund a ﬁxed and determinable amount by a
speciﬁed date; and
(3) The note must be executed and enforceable before
quarter-end.
Although a holding company may have a general intent
to, or may have entered into a capital maintenance
agreement with the institution that calls for it to, maintain
the institution’s capital at a speciﬁed level, this general
intent or agreement alone would not constitute evidence
that a note receivable existed at quarter-end. Further-
more, if a note receivable for a capital contribution
obligates the note issuer to pay a variable amount, the
institution must offset the note and equity capital. Simi-
larly, an obligor’s issuance of several notes having ﬁxed
face amounts, taken together, would be considered a
single note receivable having a variable payment amount,
which would require all the notes to be offset in equity
capital as of the quarter-end report date.
Capitalization of Interest Costs: Interest costs associ-
ated with the construction of a building shall, if material,
be capitalized as part of the cost of the building. Such
interest costs include both the actual interest incurred
when the construction funds are borrowed and the inter-
est costs imputed to internal ﬁnancing of a construction
project.
The interest rate utilized to capitalized interest on inter-
nally ﬁnanced projects in the reporting period shall be the
rate(s) applicable to the holding company’s borrowings
outstanding during the period. For this purpose, a holding
company’s borrowings include interest-bearing deposits
and other interest-bearing liabilities. The interest capital-
ized shall not exceed the total amount of interest cost
incurred by the holding company during the reporting
period.

draft. Arrival drafts are usually forwarded by the shipper

Coupon Stripping, Treasury Receipts, and STRIPS:
Coupon stripping occurs when a security holder physi-
cally detaches unmatured coupons from the principal
portion of a security and sells either the detached cou-
pons or the ex-coupon security separately. (Such trans-
actions are generally considered by the Federal Reserve
to represent “improper investment practices” for holding
companies.) In accounting for such transactions, the
carrying amount of the security must be allocated between
the ex-coupon security and the detached coupons based
on their relative fair values at the date of the sale in
accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servic-
ing. (See the Glossary entry for “Transfers of Financial
Assets.”)
Detached
U.S.
government
security
coupons
and
ex-coupon U.S. government securities that are held for
purposes other than trading, whether resulting from the
coupon stripping activities of the reporting holding com-
pany or from its purchase of stripped securities, shall be
reported as “Other domestic debt securities” in Schedule
HC-B. The amount of any discount or premium relating
to the detached coupons or ex-coupon securities must be
amortized. (See the Glossary entry for “Premiums and
Discounts.”)
A variation of coupon stripping has been developed
by several securities ﬁrms which have marketed instru-
ments with such names as CATS (Certiﬁcates of Accrual
on Treasury Securities), TIGR (Treasury Investment
Growth Receipts), COUGAR (Certiﬁcates on Govern-
ment Receipts), LION (Lehman Investment Opportunity
Notes), and ETR (East Treasury Receipts). A securities
dealer purchases U.S. Treasury securities, delivers them
to a trustee, and sells receipts representing the rights to
future interest and/or principal payments on the U.S.
Treasury securities held by the trustee. Such Treasury
receipts are not an obligation of the U.S. government and,
when held for purposes other than trading shall be reported
as other (domestic) securities in Schedule HC-B, item
6(a). The discount on these Treasury receipts must be
accreted.
Under a program called Separate Trading of Registered
Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS), the U.S.
Treasury has issued certain long-term note and bond
issues that are maintained in the book-entry system
operated by the Federal Reserve Banks in a manner that
permits separate trading and ownership of the interest
and principal payments on these issues. Even after the
interest or principal portions of U.S. Treasury STRIPS
have been separately traded, they remain obligations of
the U.S. government. STRIPS held for purposes other
than trading shall be reported as U.S. Treasury securities
Glossary

in Schedule HC-B, item 1. The discount on separately
traded portions of STRIPS must be accreted.
Detached coupons, ex-coupon securities, Treasury
receipts, and U.S. Treasury STRIPS held for trading
purposes shall be reported in Schedule HC, item 5, at fair
value.
Custody Account: A custody account is one in which
securities or other assets are held by a holding company
or subsidiary of the holding company on behalf of a
customer under a safekeeping arrangement. Assets held
in such capacity are not to be reported in the balance
sheet of the reporting bank nor are such accounts to be
reﬂected as a liability. Assets of the reporting holding
company held in custody accounts at banks that are
outside the holding company are to be reported on the
reporting holding company’s balance sheet in the appro-
priate asset categories as if held in the physical custody
of the reporting holding company.
Dealer Reserve Account: A dealer reserve account
arises when the holding company purchases at full face
value a dealer’s installment note receivables, but credits
less than the full face value directly to the dealer’s
account. The remaining amount is credited to a separate
dealer reserve account. That account is held by the
holding company as collateral for the installment notes
and, for reporting purposes, is treated as a deposit in
the appropriate items of Schedule HC-E. The bank will
subsequently disburse to the dealer predetermined por-
tions of the reserve as the purchased notes are paid in a
timely manner.
For example, if a bank purchases $100,000 in notes from
a dealer for the full face amount ($100,000) and pays to
the dealer $90,000 in cash or in credits to his/her deposit
account, the remaining $10,000, which is held as collat-
eral security, would be credited to the dealer reserve
account.
See also “Deposits.”
Debt Issuance Costs: Debt issuance costs include the
underwriting, legal, accounting, printing, and other direct
costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt.
ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest—Imputation of Interest,
requires debt issuance costs associated with a recognized
debt liability (not measured at fair value under a fair
value option) to be presented as a direct deduction from
the face amount of the related debt liability, similar to
debt discounts. Debt issuance costs, like debt discounts,
in effect reduce the proceeds of the borrowing, thereby
increasing the effective interest rate on the debt.
For purposes of these reports, institutions should report
debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the appro-
priate balance sheet liability category in Schedule HC,
e.g., item 16, “Other borrowed money,” or item 19,
“Subordinated notes and debentures.” However, debt
issuance costs associated with a recognized liability
reported at fair value under a fair value option should be
expensed as incurred.
Debt issuance costs should be amortized using the effec-
tive interest method. The amortization of debt issuance
costs should be reported as interest expense in the income
statement category appropriate to the related liability in
Schedule HI, e.g., item 2.c, “Interest on trading liabilities
and other borrowed money,” or item 2.d, “Interest on
subordinated notes and debentures.”
The guidance in ASC Subtopic 835-30 does not address
the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt
issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The
Federal Reserve would not object to an holding company
deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a
line-of-credit arrangement as an “Other asset” and subse-
quently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs rat-
ably over the term of the arrangement, regardless of
whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the
line-of-credit arrangement.
Deferred Compensation Agreements: Institutions often
enter into deferred compensation agreements with selected
employees as part of executive compensation and reten-
tion programs. These agreements are generally structured
as nonqualiﬁed retirement plans for federal income tax
purposes and are based upon individual agreements with
selected employees. Institutions purchase life insurance
in connection with many of these agreements. Bank-
owned life insurance may produce attractive tax-
equivalent yields that offset some or all of the costs of the
agreements.
Deferred compensation agreements with select employ-
ees under individual contracts generally do not constitute
postretirement income plans (i.e., pension plans) or post-
retirement health and welfare beneﬁt plans. The account-
ing for individual contracts that, when taken together, do
not represent a postretirement plan should follow ASC
Subtopic 710-10, Compensation-General – Overall. If the
individual contracts, taken together, are equivalent to a
Glossary
GL-22
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2024

plan, the plan should be accounted for under ASC
Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Beneﬁts.
ASC Subtopic 710-10 requires that an employer’s obliga-
tion under a deferred compensation agreement be accrued
according to the terms of the individual contract over the
required service period to the date the employee is fully
eligible to receive the beneﬁts, i.e., the “full eligibility
date.” Depending on the individual contract, the full
eligibility date may be the employee’s expected retire-
ment date, the date the employee entered into the con-
tract, or a date between these two dates. ASC Subtopic
710-10 does not prescribe a speciﬁc accrual method for
the beneﬁts under deferred compensation contracts, stat-
ing only that the ‘‘cost of those beneﬁts shall be accrued
over that period of the employee’s service in a systematic
and rational manner.’’ The amounts to be accrued each
period should result in a deferred compensation liability
at the full eligibility date that equals the then present
value of the estimated beneﬁt payments to be made under
the individual contract.
ASC Subtopic 710-10 does not specify how to select the
discount rate to measure the present value of the estimated
beneﬁt payments. Therefore, other relevant accounting
literature must be considered in determining an appropri-
ate discount rate. For purposes of these reports, an insti-
tution’s incremental borrowing rate5 and the current rate
of return on high-quality ﬁxed-income debt securities6 are
acceptable discount rates to measure deferred compensa-
tion agreement obligations. An institution must select and
consistently apply a discount rate policy that conforms
with generally accepted accounting principles.
For each deferred compensation agreement to be ac-
counted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 710-10, an
institution should calculate the present value of the
expected future beneﬁt payments under the agreement at
the employee’s full eligibility date. The expected future
beneﬁt payments can be reasonably estimated and should
be based on reasonable and supportable assumptions. The
estimated amount of these beneﬁt payments should be
discounted because the beneﬁts will be paid in periodic
installments after the employee retires.
For deferred compensation agreements commonly
referred to as revenue neutral or indexed retirement
plans,7 the expected future beneﬁts should include both
the ‘‘primary beneﬁt’’ and, if the employee is entitled to
‘‘excess earnings’’ that are earned after retirement, the
‘‘secondary beneﬁt.’’ The number of periods the primary
and any secondary beneﬁt payments should be dis-
counted may differ because the discount period for each
type of beneﬁt payment should be based upon the length
of time during which each type of beneﬁt will be paid as
speciﬁed in the deferred compensation agreement.
After the present value of the expected future beneﬁt
payments has been determined, an institution should
accrue an amount of compensation expense and a liabil-
ity each year from the date the employee enters into the
deferred compensation agreement until the full eligibility
date. The amount of these annual accruals should be
sufficient to ensure that a deferred compensation liability
equal to the present value of the expected beneﬁt pay-
ments is recorded by the full eligibility date. Any method
of deferred compensation accounting that does not recog-
nize some expense in each year from the date the
employee enters into the agreement until the full eligibil-
ity date is not systematic and rational. (For indexed
retirement plans, some expense should be recognized for
the primary beneﬁt and any secondary beneﬁt in each of
these years.)
5. ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest–Imputation of Interest, states in part
that the rate used for valuation purposes will normally be at least equal to
the rate at which the debtor can obtain ﬁnancing of a similar nature from
other sources at the date of the transaction.
6. Paragraph 186 in the Basis for Conclusions of former FASB State-
ment No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Beneﬁts Other
Than Pensions,” states that “[t]he objective of selecting assumed discount
rates is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement
date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the
necessary future cash ﬂows to pay the accumulated beneﬁts when due.”
7. Revenue neutral and indexed retirement plans are deferred compensa-
tion agreements that are typically designed so that the spread each year, if
any, between the tax-equivalent earnings on bank-owned life insurance
covering an individual employee and a hypothetical earnings calculation is
deferred and paid to the employee as a postretirement beneﬁt. This spread
is commonly referred to as “excess earnings.” The hypothetical earnings
are computed based on a pre-deﬁned variable index rate (e.g., cost of funds
or federal funds rate) times a notional amount. The agreement for this type
of plan typically requires the excess earnings that accrue before an employ-
ee’s retirement to be recorded in a separate liability account. Once the
employee retires, the balance in the liability account is generally paid to
the employee in equal annual installments over a set number of years (e.g.,
10 or 15 years). These payments are commonly referred to as the “primary
beneﬁt” or “preretirement beneﬁt.” The employee may also receive the
excess earnings that are earned after retirement. This beneﬁt may continue
until his or her death and is commonly referred to as the “secondary
beneﬁt” or “postretirement beneﬁt.” The secondary beneﬁt is paid annu-
ally, once the employee has retired, in addition to the primary beneﬁt.

Vesting provisions should be reviewed to ensure that the
full eligibility date is properly determined because this
date is critical to the measurement of the liability esti-
mate. Because ASC Subtopic 710-10 requires that the
present value of the expected beneﬁt payments be
recorded by the full eligibility date, institutions also need
to consider changes in market interest rates to appropri-
ately measure deferred compensation liabilities. There-
fore, institutions should periodically review their esti-
mates of the expected future beneﬁts under deferred
compensation agreements and the discount rates used to
compute the present value of the expected beneﬁt pay-
ments and revise the estimates and rates, when appropri-
ate.
Deferred compensation agreements may include noncom-
pete provisions or provisions requiring employees to
perform consulting services during postretirement years.
If the value of the noncompete provisions cannot be
reasonably and reliably estimated, no value should be
assigned to the noncompete provisions in recognizing the
deferred compensation liability. Institutions should allo-
cate a portion of the future beneﬁt payments to consulting
services to be performed in postretirement years only if
the consulting services are determined to be substantive.
Factors to consider in determining whether postretire-
ment consulting services are substantive include, but are
not limited to, whether the services are required to be
performed, whether there is an economic beneﬁt to the
institution, and whether the employee forfeits the beneﬁts
under the agreement for failure to perform such services.
Deferred compensation liabilities should be reported on
the balance sheet in Schedule HC, item 20, ‘‘Other
liabilities,’’ and in Schedule HC-G, item 4, ‘‘Other’’
liabilities. The annual compensation expense (service
component and interest component) related to deferred
compensation agreements should be reported in the
income statement in Schedule HI, item 7(a), ‘‘Salaries
and employee beneﬁts.’’
See also ‘‘Bank-owned life insurance.’’
Deferred Income Taxes: See ‘‘Income taxes.’’
Deﬁned Beneﬁt Postretirement Plans: The accounting
and reporting standards for deﬁned beneﬁt postretirement
plans, such as pension plans and health care plans, are set
forth in ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Bene-
ﬁts. ASC Topic 715 requires an institution that sponsors a
single-employer deﬁned beneﬁt postretirement plan to
recognize the funded status of each such plan on its
balance sheet. The funded status of a beneﬁt plan is
measured as of the end of an institution’s ﬁscal year as
the difference between plan assets at fair value (with
limited exceptions) and the beneﬁt obligation. An over-
funded plan is recognized as an asset, which should be
reported in Schedule HC-F, item 6, “All other assets,”
while an underfunded plan is recognized as a liability,
which should be reported in Schedule HC-G, item 4,
“Other.”
A holding company should measure the net period
beneﬁt cost of a deﬁned beneﬁt plan for a reporting
period in accordance with ASC Subtopic 715-30 for
pension plans, and ASC Subtopic 715-60 for other
postretirement beneﬁt plans. This cost should be reported
in Schedule HI, item 7.a, “Salaries and employee bene-
ﬁts.” However, a holding company must recognize cer-
tain gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that
arise on a deﬁned beneﬁt plan during each reporting
period, net of tax, as a component of other comprehen-
sive income (Schedule HI-A, item 12) and, hence, accu-
mulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) (Schedule
HC, item 26.b). Postretirement plan amounts carried in
AOCI are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized in
earnings as components of a plan’s net periodic beneﬁt
cost. For further information on accounting for deﬁned
beneﬁt postretirement plans, institutions should refer to
ASC Topic 715.
Impact on Regulatory Capital—A holding company that
has made the AOCI opt-out election in Schedule HC-R,
Part I, item 3.a, should reverse the effects on AOCI of
ASC Subtopic 715, for purposes of reporting and measur-
ing the numerators and denominators for the leverage and
risk-based capital ratios. The intent of the reversal is to
neutralize for regulatory capital purposes the effects on
AOCI of the application of ASC Subtopic 715. The
instructions for Schedule HC-R, Part I, items 9(d) and 26,
and Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 8, provide guidance on
how to report adjustments to Tier 1 capital and risk-
weighted and total assets to reverse the effects of apply-
ing ASC Subtopic 715 for regulatory capital purposes.

Deposits: The basic statutory and regulatory deﬁnitions
of ‘‘deposits’’ are contained in Section 3(1) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act and in the Federal Reserve Regu-
lation D. The deﬁnitions in these two legal sources differ
in certain respects. Furthermore, for purposes of these
reports, the reporting standards for deposits speciﬁed in
these instructions do not strictly follow the precise legal
deﬁnitions in these two sources. In addition, deposits for
purposes of this report, include deposits of thrift institu-
tions. The deﬁnitions of deposits to be reported in the
deposit items of the Consolidated Financial Statements
of Holding Companies are discussed below under the
following headings:
(I) FDI Act deﬁnition of deposits.
(II) Transaction–nontransaction deposit
distinction.
(III) Interest noninterest-bearing deposit
distinction.
(I) FDI Act deﬁnition of deposits:
(1) the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received
or held by a bank in the usual course of business and
for which it has given or is obligated to give credit,
either conditionally or unconditionally, to a commer-
cial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account, or
which is evidenced by its certiﬁcate of indebtedness,
or other similar name, or a check or draft drawn
against a deposit account and certiﬁed by the bank, or
a letter of credit or a traveler’s check on which the
bank is primarily liable: Provided that, without limit-
ing the generality of the term ‘‘money or its equiva-
lent,’’ any such account or instrument must be
regarded as evidencing the receipt of the equivalent
of money when credited or issued in exchange for
checks or drafts or for a promissory note upon which
the person obtaining any such credit or instrument is
primarily or secondarily liable, or for a charge against
a deposit account, or in settlement of checks, drafts,
or other instruments forwarded to such bank for
collection.
(2) trust funds as deﬁned in this Act received or held by
such bank, whether held in the trust department or
held or deposited in any other department of such
bank.
(3) money received or held by a bank, or the credit given
for money or its equivalent received or held by a
bank, in the usual course of business for a special or
speciﬁc purpose, regardless of the legal relationship
thereby established, including without being limited
to, escrow funds, funds held as security for an
obligation due to the bank or others (including funds
held as dealers reserves) or for securities loaned by
the bank, funds deposited by a debtor to meet
maturing obligations, funds deposited as advance
payment on subscriptions to United States govern-
ment securities, funds held for distribution or pur-
chase of securities, funds held to meet its acceptances
or letters of credit, and withheld taxes: Provided that
there shall not be included funds which are received
by the bank for immediate application to the reduc-
tion of an indebtedness to the receiving bank, or
under condition that the receipt thereof immediately
reduces or extinguishes such an indebtedness.

(4) outstanding draft (including advice or authorization
to charge bank’s balance in another bank), cashier’s
check, money order, or other officer’s check issued in
the usual course of business for any purpose, includ-
ing without being limited to those issued in payment
for services, dividends, or purchases, and
(5) such other obligations of a bank as the Board of
Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion, after consultation with the Comptroller of the
Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, shall ﬁnd and prescribe by regula-
tion to be deposit liabilities by general usage.
(II) Transaction–nontransaction deposit distinction:
Deposits deﬁned in Regulation D as transaction
accounts include demand deposits, NOW accounts,
telephone and preauthorized transfer accounts, and
savings deposits. However, for FR Y-9C report
purposes, savings deposits are classiﬁed as a type of
nontransaction account.
For institutions that have suspended the six transfer
limit on an account that meets the deﬁnition of a
savings deposit (as deﬁned below in the Nontransac-
tion accounts category), please refer to the “Treat-
ment of Accounts where Reporting Institutions Have
Suspended Enforcement of the Six Transfer Limit per
Regulation D” section below for further details on
reporting savings deposits.
(1) Transaction accounts—For FR Y-9C purposes, with
the exceptions noted below, a “transaction account”
is a deposit or account from which the depositor or
account holder is permitted to make transfers or
withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instru-
ments, payment orders of withdrawal, telephone
transfers, or other similar devices for the purpose of
making payments or transfers to third persons or
others or from which the depositor may make third
party payments at an automated teller machine
(ATM), a remote service unit (RSU), or another
electronic device, including by debit card.
Excluded from transaction accounts are savings
deposits (including money market deposit accounts—
MMDAs and other savings deposits) as deﬁned
below in the nontransaction account category.
For FR Y-9C purposes, transaction accounts consist
of the following types of deposits: (a) demand depos-
its; (b) NOW accounts (including accounts previ-
ously designated as “Super NOWs”); (c) ATS
accounts; and (d) telephone and preauthorized trans-
fer accounts, all as deﬁned below. Interest that is paid
by the crediting of transaction accounts is also
included in transaction accounts.
(a) Demand deposits are deposits that are payable
immediately on demand, or have an original
maturity or required notice period of less than
seven days, or that represent funds for which the
depository institution does not reserve the right to
require at least seven days’ written notice of an
intended withdrawal. Demand deposits include
any matured time deposits without automatic
renewal provisions, unless the deposit agreement
provides for the funds to be transferred at matu-
rity to another type of account. Effective July 21,
2011, demand deposits may be interest-bearing
or noninterest-bearing. Demand deposits do not
include: (i) money market deposit accounts
(MMDAs) or (ii) NOW accounts, as deﬁned
below in this entry.
(b) NOW accounts are interest-bearing deposits (i) on
which the depository institution has reserved the
right to require at least seven days’ written notice
prior to withdrawal or transfer of any funds in the
account and (ii) that can be withdrawn or trans-
ferred to third parties by issuance of a negotiable
or transferable instrument.
NOW accounts, as authorized by federal law, are
limited to accounts held by:
(i) Individuals or sole proprietorships;
(ii) Organizations that are operated primarily for
religious, philanthropic, charitable, educa-
tional, or other similar purposes and that are
not operated for proﬁt. These include orga-
nizations, partnerships, corporations, or asso-
ciations that are not organized for proﬁt and
are described in section 501(c)(3) through
(13) and (19) and section 528 of the Internal
Revenue Code, such as church organiza-
tions; professional associations; trade asso-
ciations; labor unions; fraternities, sororities
and similar social organizations; and non-
proﬁt recreational clubs; or
(iii) Governmental units including the federal
government; state governments; county and
Glossary

municipal governments and their political
subdivisions; the District of Columbia; the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American
Samoa, Guam, and any territory or posses-
sion of the United States and their political
subdivisions.
Also included are the balances of all NOW
accounts of certain other nonproﬁt organiza-
tions that may not fall within the above
description but that had established NOW
accounts with the reporting institution prior
to September 1, 1981.
NOTE: There are no regulatory requirements
with respect to minimum balances to be main-
tained in a NOW account or to the amount of
interest that may be paid on a NOW account.
(c) ATS accounts are deposits or accounts of indi-
viduals on which the depository institution has
reserved the right to require at least seven days’
written notice prior to withdrawal or transfer of
any funds in the account and from which, pursu-
ant to written agreement arranged in advance
between the reporting institution and the deposi-
tor, withdrawals may be made automatically
through payment to the depository institution
itself or through transfer of credit to a demand
deposit or other account in order to cover checks
or drafts drawn upon the institution or to main-
tain a speciﬁed balance in, or to make periodic
transfers to, such other accounts.
(d) Telephone or preauthorized transfer accounts
consist of deposits or accounts (1) in which the
entire beneﬁcial interest is held by a party eli-
gible to hold a NOW account, and (2) on which
the reporting institution has reserved the right to
require at least seven days’ written notice prior to
withdrawal or transfer of any funds in the account.
A
“preauthorized
transfer”
includes
any
arrangement by the reporting institution to pay
a third party from the account of a depositor
(1) upon written or oral instruction (including an
order received through an automated clearing
house (ACH), or (2) at a predetermined time or
on a ﬁxed schedule.
Telephone and preauthorized transfer accounts
also include (1) the balances of deposits or
accounts that otherwise meet the deﬁnition of
savings deposits (other than MMDAs) or time
deposits, but from which payments may be made
to third parties by means of a debit card, an
automated teller machine, remote service unit or
other electronic device, regardless of the number
of payments made; and (2) deposits or accounts
maintained in connection with an arrangement
that permits the depositor to obtain credit directly
or indirectly through the drawing of a negotiable
or nonnegotiable check, draft, order or instruc-
tion or other similar device (including telephone
or electronic order or instruction) on the issuing
institution that can be used for purposes of
making payments or transfers to third persons
or others, or to another deposit account of the
depositor.
(2) Nontransaction accounts—All deposits that are not
transaction accounts (as deﬁned above) are non trans-
action accounts. Nontransaction accounts include:
(a) savings deposits (including MMDAs and other
savings deposits) and (b) time deposits (time certiﬁ-
cates of deposit and time deposits, open account).
Regulation D no longer distinguishes between money
market deposit accounts (MMDAs) and other savings
deposits. However, these two types of accounts are
deﬁned as follows for purposes of these reports.
NOTE: Regulation D classiﬁes savings deposits as a
type of transaction account. However, for FR Y-9C
report purposes, savings deposits are classiﬁed as a
type of nontransaction account.
(a) Savings deposits are deposits that are not payable
on a speciﬁed date or after a speciﬁed period of
time from the date of deposit, but for which the
reporting institution expressly reserves the right
to require at least seven days’ written notice
before an intended withdrawal.
Further, savings deposit accounts have no mini-
mum balance required by regulation, no regula-
tory limitation on the amount of interest that may
be paid, and no minimum maturity required
(although depository institutions must reserve the
right to require at least seven days’ written notice
prior to withdrawal as stipulated above for a
savings deposit).

Any depository institution may place restrictions
and requirements on savings deposits in addition
to those stipulated above for each respective
account and in Federal Reserve Regulation D.
Treatment of Accounts where Reporting Institu-
tion Have Suspended Enforcement of the Six
Transfer Limit per Regulation D
Where the reporting institution has suspended the
enforcement of the six transfer limit rule on an
account that meets the deﬁnition of a savings
deposit, the reporting institution is required to
report such deposits as a savings account or a
transaction account based on an assessment of
the characteristics of the account as indicated
below:
1) If the reporting institution does not retain the
reservation of right to require at least seven
days’ written notice before an intended with-
drawal, report the account as a demand deposit
(and as a “transaction account”).
2) If the reporting institution does retain the
reservation of right to require at least seven
days’ written notice before an intended with-
drawal, report the account as either a NOW8
account (and as a “transaction account”) or as
a savings deposit (and as a nontransaction
account).
Regulation D no longer distinguishes between
money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) and
other savings deposits. However, these two types
of accounts are deﬁned as follows for purposes of
these reports, which call for separate data on
each.
(1) Money market deposit accounts (MMDAs)
are deposits or accounts that meet the above
deﬁnition of a savings deposit and that per-
mit unlimited transfers to be made by check,
draft, debit card or similar order made by the
depositor and payable to third parties.
(2) Other savings deposits are deposits or
accounts that meet the above deﬁnition of a
savings deposit but that permit no transfers
by check, draft, debit card, or similar order
made by the depositor and payable to third
parties. Other savings deposits are commonly
known as passbook savings or statement
savings accounts.
Examples
illustrating
distinctions
between
MMDAs and other savings deposits for purposes
of these reports are provided at the end of this
Glossary entry.
(b) Time deposits are payable on a speciﬁed date not
less than seven days after the date of deposit or
payable at the expiration of a speciﬁed time not
less than seven days after the date of deposit, or
payable only upon written notice that is actually
required to be given by the depositor not less than
seven days prior to withdrawal. Also, the deposi-
tor does not have a right, and is not permitted, to
make withdrawals from time deposits within six
days after the date of deposit unless the deposit is
subject to an early withdrawal penalty of at least
seven days’ simple interest on amounts withdrawn
within the ﬁrst six days after deposit.9 A time
deposit from which partial early withdrawals are
permitted must impose additional early with-
drawal penalties of at least seven days’ simple
interest on amounts withdrawn within six days
after each partial withdrawal. If such additional
early withdrawal penalties are not imposed, the
account ceases to be a time deposit. The account
may become a savings deposit if it meets the
requirements for a savings deposit; other wise it
becomes a demand deposit.
NOTE: The above prescribed penalties are the
minimum required by Federal Reserve Regula-
tion D. Institutions may choose to require penal-
ties for early withdrawal in excess of the
regulatory minimums.
Time deposits take two forms:
(i) Time certiﬁcates of deposit (including roll-
over certiﬁcates of deposit) are deposits
evidenced by a negotiable or nonnego-
tiable instrument, or a deposit in book
8. The option to report as a NOW account (and a transaction account) is
only applicable to holding companies that offer NOW accounts. Holding
companies that do not offer NOW accounts should continue to report such
deposits as a savings deposit (and as a nontransaction account).
9. Accounts existing on March 31, 1986, may satisfy the early with-
drawal penalties speciﬁed by Federal Reserve Regulation D by meeting the
Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee’s early withdrawal penal-
ties in existence on March 31, 1986.

entry form evidenced by a receipt or simi-
lar acknowledgement issued by the bank,
that provides, on its face, that the amount
of such deposit is payable to the bearer, to
any speciﬁed person, or to the order of a
speciﬁed person as follows:
(a) on a certain date not less than seven
days after the date of deposit,
(b) at the expiration of a speciﬁed period
not less than seven days after the date
of the deposit, or
(c) upon written notice to the bank which
is to be given not less than seven days
before the date of withdrawal.
(ii) Time deposits, open account are deposits
(other than time certiﬁcates of deposit) for
which there is in force a written contract
with the depositor that neither the whole
nor any part of such deposit may be with-
drawn prior to:
(a) the date of maturity which shall be not
less than seven days after the date of
the deposit, or
(b) the expiration of a speciﬁed period of
written notice of not less than seven
days. These deposits include ‘‘club
accounts.’’ For purposes of the Con-
solidated
Financial
Statements
of
Holding Companies, ‘‘club accounts’’
consist of accounts, such as Christmas
club and vacation club accounts, made
under written contracts that provide
that no withdrawal shall be made until
a certain number of periodic deposits
have been made during a period of not
less than three months, even though
some of the deposits are made within
six days of the end of such period.
Time deposits do not include the following
categories of liabilities even if they have an
original maturity of seven days or more:
(1) Any deposit or account that otherwise
meets the deﬁnition of a time deposit but
that allows withdrawals within the ﬁrst
six days after deposit and that does not
require an early withdrawal penalty of at
least seven days’ simple interest on
amounts withdrawn within those ﬁrst six
days. Such deposits or accounts that meet
the deﬁnition of a savings deposit shall
be reported as savings deposits; other-
wise they shall be reported as demand
deposits.
(2) The remaining balance of a time deposit
if a partial early withdrawal is made and
the remaining balance is not subject to
additional early withdrawal penalties of
at least seven days’ simple interest on
amounts withdrawn within six days after
each partial withdrawal. Such time depos-
its that meet the deﬁnition of a savings
deposit shall be reported as savings
deposits; otherwise they shall be reported
as demand deposits.
Reporting of Retail Sweep Arrangements—When a
depository institution establishes a retail sweep program,
the depository institution must ensure that its customer
account agreements provide for the existence of two
distinct accounts rather than a single account and the
funds are actually transferred between these two accounts
as described in the customer contract.
There are two key criteria for retail sweep programs:
(1)
A depository institution must establish by agree-
ment with its customer two legally separate accounts;
(2) The swept funds must actually be moved between the
customer’s two accounts on the official books and
records of the depository institution as of the close of
the business on the day(s) on which the depository
institution intends to report the funds.
A retail sweep program may not exist solely in records or
on systems that do not constitute official books and
records of the depository institution and that are not used
for any purpose other than generating its Report of
Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash
(FR 2900) for submission to the Federal Reserve.
Further, for purposes of the FR Y-9C report, if all of the
criteria above are met, a holding company must deter-
mine the appropriate reporting of the accounts that are
components of a retail sweep program separately when it
reports its quarter-end deposit information in Sched-
ules HC, HC-E, its quarterly averages in Schedule HC-K,
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-29
Glossary
March 2021

and its interest expense (if any) in Schedule HI. Thus,
when reporting quarterly averages in Schedule HC-K, a
holding company should include the accounts (excluding
noninterest-bearing demand deposits) involved in the
retail sweep arrangements each day or each week in the
appropriate separate items for average deposits. In addi-
tion, if the bank subsidiary pays interest on accounts
involved in retail sweep arrangements, the interest expense
reported in Schedule HI should be allocated between
both accounts based on the balances in these accounts
during the reporting period.
Interest noninterest-bearing deposit distinction:
(1) Interest-bearing deposit accounts consist of deposit
accounts on which the issuing depository institution
makes any payment to or for the account of any
depositor as compensation for the use of funds
constituting a deposit. Such compensation may be in
the form of cash, merchandise, or property or as a
credit to an account. An institution’s absorption of
expenses incident to providing a normal banking
function or its forbearance from charging a fee in
connection with such a service is not considered a
payment of interest.
Deposits with a zero percent interest rate that are
issued on a discount basis are to be treated as
interest-bearing. Deposit accounts on which the inter-
est rate is periodically adjusted in response to changes
in market interest rates and other factors should be
reported as interest-bearing even if the rate has been
reduced zero, provided the interest rate on these
accounts can be increased as market conditions
change.
(2) Noninterest-bearing deposit accounts consist of
deposit accounts on which the issuing depository
institution makes no payment to or for the account of
any depositor as compensation for the use of funds
constituting a deposit. An institution’s absorption of
expenses incident to providing a normal banking
function or its forbearance from charging a fee in
connection with such a service is not considered a
payment of interest.
Noninterest-bearing deposit accounts include (i)
matured time deposits that are not automatically
renewable (unless the deposit agreement provides for
the funds to be transferred at maturity to another type
of account) and (ii) deposits with a zero percent
stated interest rate that are issued at face value.
See also “Brokered deposits” and “Hypothecated depos-
its.”
Derivative Contracts: Holding companies commonly
use derivative instruments for managing (positioning or
hedging) their exposure to market risk (including interest
rate risk and foreign exchange risk), cash ﬂow risk, and
other risks in their operations and for trading. The
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instru-
ments, including certain derivative instruments embed-
ded in other contracts, and for hedging activities are set
forth in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which
holding companies must follow for purposes of these
reports. ASC Topic 815 requires all derivatives to be
recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities at their fair value. For further information,
holding companies should refer to the subtopics within
ASC Topic 815, as appropriate, for a comprehensive
understanding of the accounting for derivatives and
hedging activities.
When applicable, institutions may also refer to Account-
ing Standards Update No. ASU 2020-04, “Reference
Rate Reform (Topic 848),” (ASU 2020-04), which pro-
vides optional expedients for fair value, cash ﬂow, and
net investment hedging relationships affected by refer-
ence rate reform for a limited period of time to ease the
potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the
effects of) reference rate reform on ﬁnancial reporting as
the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other
reference rates are being discontinued. ASU 2020-04
provides exceptions to the guidance in ASC Topic 815
related to changes to the critical terms of a hedging
relationship due to reference rate reform.
Deﬁnition of Derivative
ASC Topic 815 deﬁnes a “derivative instrument” as a
ﬁnancial instrument or other contract with all three of the
following characteristics:
(1) It has one or more underlyings (i.e., speciﬁed interest
rate, security price, commodity price, foreign
exchange rate, index of prices or rates, or other
variable) and one or more notional amounts (i.e.,
number of currency units, shares, bushels, pounds, or
other units speciﬁed in the contract) or payment
provisions or both. These terms determine the amount
Glossary
GL-30
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2021

of the settlement or settlements, and in some cases,
whether or not a settlement is required.
(2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net
investment that is smaller than would be required for
other types of contracts that would be expected to
have similar response to changes in market factors.
(3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, it can be
readily settled net by a means outside the contract, or
it provides for delivery of an asset that puts the
recipient in a position not substantially different from
net settlement.
Certain contracts that may meet the deﬁnition of a
derivative are speciﬁcally excluded from the scope of
ASC Topic 815, including:
• “regular-way” securities trades, which are trades that
are completed within the time period generally estab-
lished by regulations and conventions in the market-
place or by the exchange on which the trade is
executed;
• normal purchases and sales of an item other than a
ﬁnancial instrument or derivative instrument (e.g., a
commodity) that will be delivered in quantities expected
to be used or sold by the reporting entity over a
reasonable period in the normal course of business;
• traditional life insurance and property and casualty
contracts; and
• certain ﬁnancial guarantee contracts.
ASC Topic 815 has special criteria for determining
whether commitments to originate loans meet the deﬁni-
tion of a derivative. Commitments to originate mortgage
loans that will be held for sale are accounted for as
derivatives. Commitments to originate mortgage loans
that will be held for investment are not accounted for as
derivatives. Also, all commitments to originate loans
other than mortgage loans are not accounted for as
derivatives. Commitments to purchase loans must be
evaluated to determine whether the commitment meets
the deﬁnition of a derivative under ASC Topic 815.
Types of Derivatives
The most common types of freestanding derivatives are
forwards, futures, swaps, options, caps, ﬂoors, and col-
lars.
Forward contracts are agreements that obligate two
parties to purchase (long) and sell (short) a speciﬁc
ﬁnancial instrument, foreign currency, or commodity at a
speciﬁed price with delivery and settlement at a speciﬁed
future date.
Futures contracts are standardized forward contracts that
are traded on organized exchanges. Exchanges in the U.S.
are registered with and regulated by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. The deliverable ﬁnancial
instruments underlying interest-rate future contracts are
speciﬁed investment-grade ﬁnancial instruments, such as
U.S. Treasury securities or mortgage-backed securities.
Foreign currency futures contracts involve speciﬁed
deliverable amounts of a particular foreign currency. The
deliverable products under commodity futures contracts
are speciﬁed amounts and grades of commodities such as
gold bullion. Equity futures contracts are derivatives that
have a portion of their return linked to the price of a
particular equity or to an index of equity prices, such as
the Standard and Poor’s 500.
Other forward contracts are traded over the counter and
their terms are not standardized. Such contracts can only
be terminated, other than by receipt of the underlying
asset, by agreement of both buyer and seller. A forward
rate agreement is a forward contract that speciﬁes a
reference interest rate and an agreed on interest rate (one
to be paid and one to be received), an assumed principal
amount (the notional amount), and a speciﬁc maturity
and settlement date.
Swap contracts are forward-based contracts in which two
parties agree to swap streams of payments over a speci-
ﬁed period. The payments are based on an agreed upon
notional principal amount. An interest rate swap gener-
ally involves no exchange of principal at inception or
maturity. Rather, the notional amount is used to calculate
the payment streams to be exchanged. However, foreign
exchange swaps often involve the exchange of principal.
Option contracts (standby contracts) are traded on
exchanges and over the counter. Option contracts grant
the right, but do not obligate, the purchaser (holder) to
buy (call) or sell (put) a speciﬁc or standard commodity,
ﬁnancial, or equity instrument at a speciﬁed price during
a speciﬁed period or at a speciﬁed date. A purchased
option is a contract in which the buyer has paid compen-
sation (such as a fee or premium) to acquire the right to
sell or purchase an instrument at a stated price on a
speciﬁed future date. A written option obligates the
Glossary

option seller to purchase or sell the instrument at the
option of the buyer of the contract. Option contracts may
relate to purchases or sales of securities, money market
instruments, futures contracts, other ﬁnancial instru-
ments, or commodities.
Interest rate caps are option contracts in which the cap
seller, in return for a premium, agrees to limit the cap
holder’s risk associated with an increase in interest rates.
If rates go above a speciﬁed interest-rate level (the strike
price or cap rate), the cap holder is entitled to receive cash
payments equal to the excess of the market rate over the
strike price multiplied by the notional principal amount.
For example, an issuer of ﬂoating-rate debt may purchase
a cap to protect against rising interest rates, while retaining
the ability to beneﬁt from a decline in rates.
Interest rate ﬂoors are option contracts in which the ﬂoor
seller, in return for a premium, agrees to limit the risk
associated with a decline in interest rates based on a
notional amount. If rates fall below an agreed rate, the
ﬂoor holder will receive cash payments from the ﬂoor
writer equal to the difference between the market rate and
an agreed rate, multiplied by the notional principal amount.
Interest rate collars are option contracts that combine a
cap and a ﬂoor (one held and one written). Interest rate
collars enable a user with a ﬂoating rate contract to lock
into a predetermined interest-rate range often at a lower
cost than a cap or a ﬂoor.
Embedded Derivatives
Contracts that do not in their entirety meet the deﬁnition
of a derivative instrument, such as bonds, insurance
policies, and leases, may contain ‘‘embedded’’ derivative
instruments. Embedded derivatives are implicit or explicit
terms within a contract that affect some or all of the cash
ﬂows or the value of other exchanges required by the
contract in a manner similar to a derivative instrument.
The effect of embedding a derivative instrument in
another type of contract (‘‘the host contract’’) is that
some or all of the cash ﬂows or other exchanges that
otherwise would be required by the host contract, whether
unconditional or contingent upon the occurrence of a
speciﬁed event, will be modiﬁed based on one or more of
the underlyings.
An embedded derivative instrument shall be separated
from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative
instrument, i.e., bifurcated, if and only if all three of the
following conditions are met:
(1) The economic characteristics and risks of the embed-
ded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely
related to the economic characteristics and risks of
the host contract,
(2) The contract (‘‘the hybrid instrument’’) that embod-
ies the embedded derivative and the host contract is
not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applica-
ble generally accepted accounting principles with
changes in fair value reported in earnings as they
occur, and
(3) A separate instrument with the same terms as the
embedded derivative instrument would be a consid-
ered a derivative.
An embedded derivative instrument in which the under-
lying is an interest rate or interest rate index that alters
net interest payments that otherwise would be paid or
received on an interest-bearing host contract is consid-
ered to be clearly and closely related to the host contract
unless either of the following conditions exist:
(1) The hybrid instrument can contractually be settled in
such a way that the investor (holder) would not
recover substantially all of its initial recorded invest-
ment, or
(2) The embedded derivative could at least double the
investor’s initial rate of return on the host contract
and could also result in a rate of return that is at least
twice what otherwise would be the market return for
a contract that has the same terms as the host contract
and that involves a debtor with a similar credit
quality.
Examples of hybrid instruments (not held for trading
purposes) with embedded derivatives which meet the
three conditions listed above and must be accounted for
separately include debt instruments (including deposit
liabilities) whose return or yield is indexed to: changes in
an equity securities index (e.g., the Standard & Poor’s
500); changes in the price of a speciﬁc equity security; or
changes in the price of gold, crude oil, or some other
commodity. For purposes of these reports, when an
embedded derivative must be accounted for separately
from the host contract under ASC Topic 815, the carrying
value of the host contract and the fair value of the
embedded derivative may be combined and presented
together on the balance sheet in the asset or liability
category appropriate to the host contract.

Under ASC Subtopic 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging –
Embedded Derivatives, a holding company with a hybrid
instrument for which bifurcation would otherwise be
required is permitted to irrevocably elect to initially and
subsequently measure the hybrid instrument in its entirety
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
earnings. In addition, ASC Subtopic 815-15 subjects all
but the simplest forms of interest-only and principal-only
strips and all forms of beneﬁcial interests in securitized
ﬁnancial assets to the requirements of ASC Topic 815.
Thus, a holding company must evaluate such instruments
to identify those that are freestanding derivatives or that
are hybrid ﬁnancial instruments that contain an embed-
ded derivative requiring bifurcation. However, a beneﬁ-
cial interest that contains a concentration of credit risk in
the form of subordination to another ﬁnancial instrument
and certain securitized interests in prepayable ﬁnancial
assets are not considered to contain embedded deriva-
tives that must be accounted for separately from the host
contract.
For
further
information,
see
ASC
Subtopic 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging – Embedded
Derivatives.
Except in limited circumstances, interest-only and
principal-only strips and beneﬁcial interests in securi-
tized assets that were recognized prior to the effective
date (or early adoption date) of ASC Subtopic 815-15 are
not subject to evaluation for embedded derivatives under
ASC Topic 815.
Recognition of Derivatives and Measurement of Deriva-
tives and Hedged Items
A holding company should recognize all of its derivative
instruments on its balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities at fair value. As deﬁned in ASC Topic 820, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures, fair value is the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. For further
information, see the Glossary entry for “Fair Value.”
The accounting for changes in the fair value (that is,
gains and losses) of a derivative depends on whether the
derivative has been designated as, and qualiﬁes as part of
a hedging relationship under ASC Topic 815 and, if so,
on the reason for holding it. Either all or a proportion of a
derivative may be designated as a hedging instrument.
The proportion must be expressed as a percentage of the
entire derivative. Gains and losses on derivative instru-
ments are accounted for as follows:
(1) No hedging designation under ASC Topic 815—The
gain or loss on a derivative instrument not designated
in a hedge under ASC Topic 815, including all
derivatives held for trading purposes and derivatives
used in transactions that economically hedge expo-
sures to various risks, is recognized currently in
earnings through the income statement.
(2) Qualifying fair value hedge under ASC Topic 815—
For a derivative designated as and qualifying as a
hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of
a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized
ﬁrm commitment attributable to a particular risk,
which is referred to as a fair value hedge, the gain or
loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or
gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being
hedged should be recognized currently in earnings
through the income statement. For example, an expo-
sure to changes in fair value typically results from
holding or issuing a debt instrument that has a ﬁxed
interest rate or is denominated in a currency other
than the institution’s functional currency or from a
change in the credit and/or foreign exchange risk of a
held-to-maturity debt security.
(3) Qualifying cash ﬂow hedge under ASC Topic 815—A
derivative designated as and qualifying as a hedge of
the exposure to variability in the cash ﬂows of an
existing recognized asset or liability or of a fore-
casted purchase or sale transaction attributable to a
particular risk (i.e., a cash ﬂow hedge), the entire
gain or loss on the derivative should initially be
reported outside of earnings as a component of other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassiﬁed
into earnings in the same period or periods during
which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
The individual cash ﬂows related to a recognized
asset or liability and the cash ﬂows related to a
forecasted purchase or sale transaction are both
referred to as a forecasted transaction. A forecasted
transaction is eligible for designation as a hedged
transaction if the forecasted transaction is speciﬁcally
identiﬁed as a single transaction or a group of
individual transactions, the occurrence of the fore-
casted transaction is probable, and certain other
criteria speciﬁed in ASC Topic 815 are met. If the
hedged transaction is a group of individual transac-
tions, those individual transactions must share the
same risk exposure for which they are designated as
Glossary
FR Y-9C

being hedged. For example, an exposure to variabil-
ity in cash ﬂows can result from a debt instrument
with a variable interest rate or from a transaction
amount that will be settled in a nonfunctional cur-
rency.
(4) Qualifying foreign currency hedge under ASC Topic
815—For a derivative designated and qualifying as
hedging the foreign currency exposure (i.e., an expo-
sure to a currency other than the hedging unit’s
functional currency) of a net investment in a foreign
operation (i.e., a net investment hedge), the gain or
loss is reported outside of earnings in other compre-
hensive income as part of the cumulative translation
adjustment. For a derivative designated and qualify-
ing as (1) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of
an unrecognized ﬁrm commitment or an available-
for-sale security, the accounting for a fair value
hedge should be applied, or (2) hedge of the foreign
currency exposure of a foreign-currency denomi-
nated forecasted transaction, the accounting for a
cash ﬂow hedge should be applied.
For fair value and cash ﬂow hedges, an institution
may elect with appropriate documentation of its risk
management decision to recognize the initial value of
certain excluded components from the assessment of
effectiveness in earnings using a systematic and
rational method over the life of the hedging instru-
ment. Any difference between the change in fair
value of the excluded component and amounts recog-
nized in earnings under that systematic and rational
method should be recognized in other comprehensive
income. Alternatively, a holding company may elect
to record changes in the fair value of the excluded
component currently in earnings. This election should
be applied consistently to similar hedges.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the risk being hedged
must represent an exposure to an institution’s earnings.
In general, if the hedged item is a ﬁnancial asset or
liability, the designated risk being hedged can be overall
risks, (i.e., the risk of changes in the overall fair value of
the hedged item or the risk of overall changes in the
hedged cash ﬂows, or portions, components, of the total
risk within the hedged item). The components of the total
risk within the hedged item can include: (1) the risk of
changes in the fair value or cash ﬂows of the hedge item
attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate;10
(2) the risk of changes in the cash ﬂows of the hedged
item attributable to changes in the contractually speciﬁed
interest rate; (3) the risk of changes in the fair value or
cash ﬂows of the hedged item attributable to changes in
foreign exchange rates; or (4) the risk of changes in the
fair value or cash ﬂows of the hedged item attributable to
changes in the obligor’s creditworthiness. For held-to-
maturity securities, only credit risk, foreign exchange
risk, or both may be hedged. A holding company can also
hedge the risk of changes in the cash ﬂow attributable to
changes in an identiﬁed contractually speciﬁed compo-
nent of a nonﬁnancial asset in a forecasted purchase or
sale of the nonﬁnancial asset.
Designated hedging instruments and hedged items qualify
for fair value, or cash ﬂow, or net investment hedge
accounting if all of the criteria speciﬁed in ASC Topic
815 are met. These criteria include:
(1) At inception of the hedge, there is formal designation
and documentation, of the hedging relationship and
the holding company’s risk management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge, including
identiﬁcation of the eligible hedging instrument (e.g.,
the derivative), the item or transaction eligible to be
hedged, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how
the hedging instrument’s effectiveness will be
assessed. At inception of the hedge (using informa-
tion applicable as of the date of hedge inception)
there must be a reasonable basis for how the institu-
tion plans to assess the hedging instrument’s effec-
tiveness. When hedging foreign currency risk on an
after-tax basis, documentation that hedge effective-
ness will be on an after-tax basis (rather than on a
pretax basis) also is required at hedge inception.
(2) Both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing
basis, the hedging relationship is expected to be
highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in
fair value or offsetting cash ﬂows attributable to the
10. The benchmark interest rate is a widely recognized and quoted rate
in an active ﬁnancial market that is broadly indicative of the overall level
of interest rates attributable to high-credit-quality obligors in that market.
In theory, this should be a risk-free rate. In the U.S., interest rates on U.S.
Treasury securities, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) swap
rate, the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate based on the Fed Funds
Effective Rate, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
(SIFMA) Municipal Swap Rate, and the Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate are considered benchmark
interest rates.

hedged risk during the period that the hedge is
designated (i.e., term of the hedge). An assessment of
effectiveness is required whenever ﬁnancial state-
ments or earnings are reported, and at least every
three months. All assessments of effectiveness shall
be consistent with the risk management strategy
documented for that particular hedging relationship.
Some hedging relationships (e.g., those meeting the
requirements of the “shortcut” method and the “critical
terms match” method) require only a qualitative assess-
ment. For all holding companies, (a) the initial prospec-
tive quantitative assessment of hedge effectiveness may
be performed at any time after hedge designation, but no
later than the ﬁrst quarterly effectiveness testing date and,
for forecasted transactions, before the ﬁrst transaction
occurs, using data applicable as of the date of hedge
inception, and (b) the ongoing effectiveness assessments
may be qualitative and/or quantitative, assuming the
expectation of high effectiveness is reasonably sup-
ported.
In a fair value hedge, an asset or a liability is eligible for
designation as a hedged item if the hedged item is
speciﬁcally identiﬁed as either all or a speciﬁc portion of
a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized ﬁrm
commitment, the hedged item is a single asset or liability
(or a speciﬁc portion thereof) or is a portfolio of similar
assets or a portfolio of similar liabilities (or a speciﬁc
portion thereof), and certain other criteria speciﬁed in
ASC Topic 815 are met. If similar assets or similar
liabilities are aggregated and hedged as a portfolio, the
individual assets or individual liabilities must share the
risk exposure for which they are designated as being
hedged. The change in fair value attributable to the
hedged risk for each individual item in a hedged portfolio
must be expected to respond in a generally proportionate
manner to the overall change in fair value of the aggre-
gate portfolio attributable to the hedged risk.
Portfolio Layer Method
Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-01, “Derivatives
and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio
Layer Method” (ASU 2022-01) expands the current
single-layer method and allows for multiple hedged
layers of a single closed portfolio. In addition, ASU
2022-01 expands the scope of the portfolio layer method
from prepayable11 assets to also include nonprepayable
assets; speciﬁes eligible hedging instruments in a single-
layer hedge; provides additional guidance on the account-
ing for and disclosure of fair value hedge basis adjust-
ments (FVHBA) under the portfolio layer method; and
speciﬁes how hedge basis adjustments should be consid-
ered when determining credit losses for the assets
included in the closed portfolio.
ASU 2022-01 applies to all entities that elect to apply the
portfolio layer method of hedge accounting. For public
business entities, the ASU is effective for ﬁscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods
within those ﬁscal years. For all other entities, ASU
2022-01 is effective for ﬁscal years beginning after
December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those
ﬁscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
For further guidance refer to Schedule HC-B, item 7,
“Unallocated portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjust-
ments” and Schedule HC-C, item 11, “LESS: Any
unearned income on loans reﬂected in items 1-9 above.”
Recognition of Derivatives and Measurement When
Criteria for Hedge Accounting is No Longer Met
A holding company should discontinue prospectively its
use of fair value or cash ﬂow hedge accounting for an
existing hedge if any of the qualifying criteria for hedge
accounting is no longer met; the derivative expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised; or the institution removes
the designation of the hedge. For a fair value hedge, in
general, if a periodic assessment of hedge effectiveness
indicates noncompliance with the highly effective crite-
rion that must be met to qualify for hedge accounting, an
institution should not recognize an adjustment of the
carrying amount of the hedged item for the change in the
item’s fair value attributable to the hedged risk after the
last date on which compliance with the effectiveness
criterion was established.
When this occurs for a cash ﬂow hedge, the net gain or
loss on the derivative should remain in ‘‘Accumulated
other comprehensive income’’ and be reclassiﬁed into
earnings in the periods during which the hedged fore-
casted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is
probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by
the end of the originally speciﬁed time period (as docu-
mented at the inception of the hedging relationship) or
11. ASC Master Glossary deﬁnes prepayable as “able to be settled by
either party before its scheduled maturity.”
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-35
Glossary
March 2023

within an additional two-month period of time thereafter
(except as noted in ASC Topic 815), the derivative gain
or loss reported in ‘‘Accumulated other comprehensive
income’’ should be reclassiﬁed into earnings immedi-
ately.
Other Considerations
With certain limited exceptions, a nonderivative instru-
ment, such as a U.S. Treasury security, may not be
designated as a hedging instrument in a qualifying ASC
Topic 815 hedging relationship.
Reporting Derivative Contracts in the FR Y-9C
When a holding company enters into a derivative con-
tract, it should classify the derivative as either held for
trading or held for purposes other than trading (end-user
derivatives) based on the reasons for entering into the
contract. All derivatives must be reported at fair value on
the balance sheet (Schedule HC).
Trading derivatives with positive fair values should be
reported as trading assets in Schedule HC, item 5. Trading
derivatives with negative fair values should be reported as
trading liabilities in Schedule HC, item 15. Changes in the
fair value (that is, gains and losses) of trading derivatives
should be recognized currently in earnings and included in
Schedule HI, item 5(c), “Trading revenue.”
Freestanding derivatives held for purposes other than
trading (and embedded derivatives that are accounted for
separately under ASC Topic 815, which the holding
company has chosen to present separately from the host
contract on the balance sheet) that have positive fair
values should be included in Schedule HC-F, item 6,
‘‘Other’’ assets. Freestanding derivatives held for pur-
poses other than trading (and embedded derivatives that
are accounted for separately under ASC Topic 815,
which the holding company has chosen to present sepa-
rately from the host contract on the balance sheet) that
have negative fair values should be included in Schedule
HC-G, item 4, ‘‘Other’’ liabilities. Net gains (losses) on
derivatives held for purposes other than trading that are
not designated as hedging instruments should be recog-
nized currently in earnings and reported consistently as
either ‘‘Other noninterest income’’ or ‘‘Other noninterest
expense’’ in Schedule HI, item 5(l) or item 7(d), respec-
tively.
For qualifying fair value and cash ﬂow hedges, holding
companies should report both of the following in earn-
ings in Schedule HI in the same income statement item
that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged
item:
(1) The change in the fair value of the hedging derivative
instrument that is included in the assessment of
hedge effectiveness;
(2) Amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness in accordance with the discussion above
in this Glossary entry of the treatment of excluded
components; and
(3) For one or more existing hedged layer or layers that
are designated under the portfolio layer method in
accordance with ASC paragraph 815-20-25-12A, the
gain or loss (that is, the change in fair value) on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk shall not
adjust the carrying value of the individual beneﬁcial
interest or individual assets in or removed from the
closed portfolio. Instead, that amount shall be main-
tained on a closed portfolio basis and recognized
currently in earnings.
Netting of derivative assets and liabilities is prohibited on
the balance sheet except as permitted under ASC Sub-
topic 210-20, Balance Sheet – Offsetting, See the Glos-
sary entry for “Offsetting.”
Holding companies must report the notional amounts of
their derivative contracts (both freestanding derivatives
and embedded derivatives that are accounted for sepa-
rately from their host contract under ASC Topic 815) by
risk exposure in Schedule HC-L, ﬁrst by type of contract
in Schedule HC-L, item 11, and then by purpose of
contract (i.e., trading, other than trading) in Schedule
HC-L, items 12 and 13. Holding companies must then
report the gross fair values of their derivatives, both
positive and negative, by risk exposure and purpose of
contract in Schedule HC-L, item 14. However, these
items exclude credit derivatives, the notional amounts
and gross fair values of which must be reported in
Schedule HC-L, item 7.
Discounts: See “Premiums and Discounts.”
Dividends: Cash dividends are payments of cash to
stockholders in proportion to the number of shares they
own. Cash dividends on preferred and common stock
are to be reported on the date they are declared by the
holding company’s board of directors (the declaration
date) by debiting ‘‘retained earnings’’ and crediting
‘‘dividends declared not yet payable,’’ which is to be

reported in other liabilities. Upon payment of the divi-
dend, ‘‘dividends declared not yet payable’’ is debited for
the amount of the cash dividend with an offsetting credit,
normally in an equal amount, to ‘‘dividend checks out-
standing’’ which is reportable in the ‘‘official checks’’
category of the consolidated holding company’s deposit
liabilities.
A liability for dividends payable may not be accrued in
advance of the formal declaration of a dividend by the
board of directors. However, the holding company may
segregate a portion of retained earnings in the form of a
capital reserve in anticipation of the declaration of a
dividend.
Stock dividends are distributions of additional shares to
stockholders in proportion to the number of shares they
own. Stock dividends are to be reported by transferring
an amount equal to the fair value of the additional shares
issued from retained earnings to a category of permanent
capitalization (common stock and surplus). However, the
amount of any mandatory and discretionary transfers
must be reduced by the amount of any mandatory and
discretionary transfers previously made (such as those
from retained earnings to surplus for increasing the
holding company’s legal lending limit) provided such
transfers have not already been used to record a stock
dividend. In any event, the amount transferred from
retained earnings may not be less than the par or stated
value of the additional shares being issued.
Property dividends, also known as dividends in kind, are
distributions to stockholders of assets other than cash.
The transfer of securities of other companies, real prop-
erty, or any other asset owned by the reporting holding
company to a stockholder or related party is to be
recorded at the fair value of the asset on the declaration
date of the dividend. A gain or loss on the transferred
asset must be recognized in the same manner as if the
property had been disposed of in an outright sale at or
near the declaration date.
Domestic Office: For purposes of these reports, a domes-
tic office of the reporting holding company is a branch or
consolidated subsidiary (other than an Edge or Agree-
ment subsidiary) located in the 50 states of the United
States or the District of Columbia or a branch on a U.S.
military facility wherever located. However, if the report-
ing holding company is chartered and headquartered in
Puerto Rico or a U.S. territory or possession, a branch or
consolidated subsidiary located in the 50 states of the
United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or a
U.S. territory or possession is a domestic office. The
domestic offices of the reporting holding company exclude
all International Banking Facilities (IBFs); all offices of
Edge and Agreement subsidiaries, including their U.S.
offices; and all branches and other consolidated subsidi-
aries of the holding company located in foreign coun-
tries.
Domicile: Domicile is used to determine the foreign
(non-U.S. addressee) or domestic (U.S. addressee) loca-
tion of a customer of the reporting holding company for
the purposes of these reports. Domicile is determined by
the principal residence address of an individual or the
principal business address of a corporation, partnership,
or sole proprietorship. If other addresses are used for
correspondence or other purposes, only the principal
address, insofar as it is known to the reporting holding
company, should be used in determining whether a
customer should be regarded as a U.S. or non-U.S.
addressee.
For purposes of deﬁning customers of the reporting hold-
ing company, U.S. addressees include residents of the 50
states of the United States, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories and possessions. The term
U.S. addressee generally includes U.S.-based subsidiaries
of foreign banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks. Non-U.S. addressees include residents of any for-
eign country. The term non-U.S. addressee generally
includes foreign-based subsidiaries of other U.S. banks
and holding companies.
For customer identiﬁcation purposes, the IBFs of other
U.S. depository institutions are U.S. addressees. (This is
in contrast to the treatment of the IBFs of a subsidiary
bank which are treated as foreign offices of the bank.)
Due Bills: A due bill is an obligation that results when a
holding company or its subsidiaries sell an asset and
receives payment, but does not deliver the security or
other asset. A due bill can also result from a promise to
deliver an asset in exchange for value received. In both
cases, the receipt of the payment creates an obligation
regardless of whether the due bill is issued in written
form. Outstanding due bill obligations shall be reported
as borrowings in Schedule HC, item 16, ‘‘Other bor-
rowed money,’’ by the issuing holding company. Con-
versely, when the reporting holding company or its
consolidated subsidiaries are the holders of a due bill, the
Glossary

outstanding due bill obligation of the seller shall be
reported as a loan to that party.
Edge and Agreement Corporation: An Edge corpora-
tion is a federally-chartered corporation organized under
Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act and subject
to Federal Reserve Regulation K. Edge corporations are
allowed to engage only in international banking or other
ﬁnancial transactions related to international business.
An Agreement corporation is a state-chartered corpora-
tion that has agreed to operate as if it were organized
under Section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act and has
agreed to be subject to Federal Reserve Regulation K.
Agreement corporations are restricted, in general, to
international banking operations. Banks must apply to
the Federal Reserve for permission to acquire stock in an
Agreement corporation.
An Edge or Agreement subsidiary of the consolidated
holding company, i.e., the majority-owned Edge or
Agreement corporation of the consolidated holding com-
pany, is treated for purposes of these reports as a
“foreign” office of the reporting holding company.
Equity-Indexed Certiﬁcates of Deposit: Under ASC
Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, a certiﬁcate of
deposit that pays “interest” based on changes in an equity
securities index is a hybrid instrument with an embedded
derivative that must be accounted for separately from the
host contract, i.e., the certiﬁcate of deposit. For further
information, see the Glossary entry for “Derivative Con-
tracts.” Examples of equity-indexed certiﬁcates of deposit
include the “Index Powered CD” and the “Dow Jones
Industrials Indexed Certiﬁcate of Deposit.”
At the maturity date of a typical equity-indexed certiﬁ-
cate of deposit, the holder of the certiﬁcate of deposit
receives the original amount invested in the deposit plus
some or all of the appreciation, if any, in an index of
stock prices over the term of the certiﬁcate of deposit.
Thus, the equity-indexed certiﬁcate of deposit contains
an embedded equity call option. To manage the market
risk of its equity indexed certiﬁcates of deposit, an
institution that issues these deposits normally enters into
one or more separate freestanding equity derivative con-
tracts with an overall term that matches the term of the
certiﬁcates of deposit. At maturity, these separate deriva-
tives are expected to provide the institution with a cash
payment in an amount equal to the amount of apprecia-
tion, if any, in the same stock price index that is
embedded in the certiﬁcates of deposit, thereby providing
the institution with the funds to pay the ‘‘interest’’ on the
equity-indexed certiﬁcates of deposit. During the term of
the separate freestanding equity derivative contracts, the
institution will periodically make either ﬁxed or variable
payments to the counterparty on these contracts.
When an institution issues an equity-indexed certiﬁcate
of deposit, it must either account for the written equity
call option embedded in the deposit separately from the
certiﬁcate of deposit host contract or irrevocably elect to
account for the hybrid instrument (the equity-indexed
certiﬁcate of deposit) in its entirety at fair value.
• If the institution accounts for the written equity call
option separately from the certiﬁcate of deposit, the
fair value of this embedded derivative on the date the
certiﬁcate of deposit is issued must be deducted from
the amount the purchaser invested in the deposit,
creating a discount on the certiﬁcate of deposit that
must be amortized to interest expense over the term of
the deposit using the effective interest method. This
interest expense should be reported in the income
statement in the appropriate subitem of Schedule HI,
item 2(a), ‘‘Interest on deposits.’’ The equity call
option must be ‘‘marked to market’’ at least quarterly
with any changes in the fair value of the option
recognized in earnings. On the balance sheet, the
carrying value of the certiﬁcate of deposit host contract
and the fair value of the embedded equity derivative
may be combined and reported together as a deposit
liability on the balance sheet (Schedule HC) and in the
deposit schedule (Schedule HC-E).
• If the institution elects to account for the equity-
indexed certiﬁcate of deposit in its entirety at fair
value, no discount is to be recorded on the certiﬁcate of
deposit. Rather, the equity-indexed certiﬁcate of deposit
must be ‘‘marked to market’’ at least quarterly, with
changes in the instrument’s fair value reported in the
income statement consistently in either item 5(l),
‘‘Other noninterest income,’’ or item 7(d), ‘‘Other
noninterest expense’’, excluding interest expense
incurred that is reported in the appropriate subitem of
Schedule HI, item 2(a), ‘‘Interest on deposits.’’
As for the separate freestanding derivative contracts the
institution enters into to manage its market risk, these
derivatives must be carried on the balance sheet as assets
or liabilities at fair value and ‘‘marked to market’’ at least
quarterly with changes in their fair value recognized in
earnings. The fair value of the freestanding derivatives
Glossary
GL-38
FR Y-9C
Glossary

should not be netted against the fair value of the embed-
ded equity derivatives for balance sheet purposes because
these two derivatives have different counterparties. The
periodic payments to the counterparty on these freestand-
ing derivatives must be accrued with the expense reported
in earnings along with the change in the derivative’s fair
value. In the income statement (Schedule HI), the
changes in the fair value of the embedded and freestand-
ing derivatives, including the effect of the accruals for the
payments to the counterparty on the freestanding deriva-
tives, should be netted and reported consistently in either
item 5(l), ‘‘Other noninterest income,’’ or item 7(d),
‘‘Other noninterest expense.’’
Unless the institution that issues the equity-indexed cer-
tiﬁcate of deposit elects to account for the certiﬁcate of
deposit in its entirety at fair value, the notional amount of
the embedded equity call option must be reported in
Schedule HC-L, item 11(d)(1), column C, and item 13,
column C, and its fair value (which will always be
negative or zero, but not positive) must be reported in
Schedule HC-L, item 14(b)(2), column C. The notional
amount of the freestanding equity derivative must be
reported in the appropriate subitem of Schedule HC-L,
item 11, column C (e.g., item 11(e), column C, if it is an
equity swap), and in Schedule HC-L, item 13, column C.
The fair value of the freestanding equity derivative must
be included in the appropriate subitem of Schedule HC-L,
item 14(b), column C. The equity derivative embedded in
the equity-indexed certiﬁcate of deposit is a written option,
which is not covered by the Federal Reserve’s risk-based
capital standards. However, the freestanding equity deriva-
tive is covered by these standards.
An institution that purchases an equity-indexed certiﬁ-
cate of deposit for investment purposes must either
account for the embedded purchased equity call option
separately from the certiﬁcate of deposit host contract or
irrevocably elect to account for the hybrid instrument
(the equity-indexed certiﬁcate of deposit) in its entirety at
fair value.
• If the institution accounts for the purchased equity call
option separately from the certiﬁcate of deposit, the
fair value of this embedded derivative on the date of
purchase must be deducted from the purchase price of
the certiﬁcate, creating a discount on the deposit that
must be accreted into income over the term of the
deposit using the effective interest method. This accre-
tion should be reported in the income statement in
Schedule HI, item 1(c). The embedded equity deriva-
tive must be ‘‘marked to market’’ at least quarterly with
any changes in its fair value recognized in earnings.
These fair value changes should be reported consis-
tently in Schedule HI in either item 5(l), ‘‘Other
noninterest income,’’ or item 7(d), ‘‘Other noninterest
expense.’’ The carrying value of the certiﬁcate of
deposit host contract and the fair value of the embed-
ded equity derivative may be combined and reported
together as interest-bearing balances due from other
depository institutions on the balance sheet in Schedule
HC, item 1(b).
• If the institution elects to account for the equity-
indexed certiﬁcate of deposit in its entirety at fair
value, no discount is to be recorded on the certiﬁcate of
deposit. Rather, the equity-indexed certiﬁcate of deposit
must be ‘‘marked to market’’ at least quarterly, with
changes in the instrument’s fair value reported in the
income statement consistently in either item 5(l),
‘‘Other noninterest income,’’ or item 7(d), ‘‘Other
noninterest expense,’’ excluding interest income that is
reported in Schedule HI, item 1(c).
Unless the institution that purchases the equity-indexed
certiﬁcate of deposit elects to account for the certiﬁcate
of deposit in its entirety at fair value, the notional amount
of the embedded derivative must be reported in Schedule
HC-L, item 11(d)(2), column C, and item 13, column C,
and its fair value (which will always be positive or zero,
but not negative) must be reported in Schedule HC-L,
item 14(b)(1), column C. The embedded equity deriva-
tive in the equity-indexed certiﬁcate of deposit is a
purchased option, which is subject to the Federal
Reserve’s risk-based capital standards unless the fair
value election has been made.
Equity Method of Accounting: The equity method of
accounting shall be used to account for:
(1) Investments in subsidiaries that have not been con-
solidated; associated companies; and corporate joint
ventures, unincorporated joint ventures, and general
partnerships over which the holding company exer-
cises signiﬁcant inﬂuence; and
(2) Noncontrolling investments in:
(a) Limited partnerships; and
(b) Limited liability companies that maintain ‘‘spe-
ciﬁc ownership accounts’’ for each investor and

are within the scope of ASC Subtopic 323-30,
Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures –
Partnerships, Joint Ventures, and Limited Liabil-
ity Entities.
unless the investment in the limited partnership or limited
liability company is so minor that the limited partner or
investor may have virtually no inﬂuence over the operat-
ing and ﬁnancial policies of the partnership or company.
Consistent with guidance in ASC Subtopic 323-30,
Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures – Partner-
ships, Joint Ventures, and Limited Liability Entities,
noncontrolling investments of more than 3 to 5 percent
are considered to be more than minor.
The entities in which these investments have been made
are collectively referred to as ‘‘investees.’’
Under the equity method, the carrying value a holding
company’s investment in an investee is originally recorded
at cost but is adjusted periodically to record as income
the holding company’s proportionate share of the invest-
ee’s earnings or losses and decreased by the amount of
cash dividends or similar distributions received from the
investee. For purposes of the FR Y-9C report, the date
through which the carrying value of the holding com-
pany’s investment in an investee has been adjusted
should, to the extent practicable, match the report date of
the FR Y-9C, but in no case differ by more than 93 days
from the report.
See also “Subsidiaries.”
Excess Balance Account: An excess balance account
(EBA) is a limited-purpose account at a Federal Reserve
Bank established for maintaining the excess balances of
one or more depository institutions (participants) that are
eligible to earn interest on balances held at the Federal
Reserve Banks. An EBA is managed by another deposi-
tory institution that has its own account at a Federal
Reserve Bank (such as a participant’s pass-through cor-
respondent) and acts as an agent on behalf of the
participants. Balances in an EBA represent a liability of a
Federal Reserve Bank directly to the EBA participants
and not to the agent. The Federal Reserve Banks pay
interest on the average balance in the EBA over a 7-day
maintenance period and the agent disburses that interest
to each participant in accordance with the instructions of
the participant. Only a participant’s excess balances may
be placed in an EBA; the account balance cannot be used
to satisfy the participant’s reserve balance requirements.
The reporting of an EBA by participants and agents
differs from the required reporting of a pass-through
reserve relationship, which is described in the Glossary
entry for “Pass-Through Reserve Balances.”
A participant’s balance in an EBA is to be treated as a
claim on a Federal Reserve Bank (not as a claim on the
agent) and, as such, should be reported on the balance
sheet in Schedule HC, item 1.b, “Interest-bearing bal-
ances” due from depository institutions. For risk-based
capital purposes, the participant’s balance in an EBA is
accorded a zero percent risk weight and should be
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part II, item 1, “Cash and
balances due from depository institutions,” column C. A
participant should not include its balance in an EBA in
Schedule HC, item 3.a, ”Federal funds sold.”
The balances in an EBA should not be reﬂected as an
asset or a liability on the balance sheet of the depository
institution that acts as the agent for the EBA. Thus, the
agent should not include the balances in the EBA in
Schedule HC, item 1.b, “Interest-bearing balances” due
from depository institutions; Schedule HC, item 13.a.(2),
“Interest-bearing deposits (in domestic offices); or Sched-
ule HC-R, Part II, item 1, “Cash and balances due from
depository institutions.”
Extinguisments of Liabilities: The accounting and
reporting standards for extinguishments of liabilities are
set forth in ASC Subtopic 405-20, Liabilities – Extinguish-
ments of Liabilities. Under ASC Subtopic 405-20, a
holding company should remove a previously recognized
liability from its balance sheet if and only if the liability
has been extinguished. A liability has been extinguished if
either of the following conditions are met:
(1) The holding company pays the creditor and is
relieved of its obligation for the liability. Paying the
creditor includes delivering cash, other ﬁnancial
assets, goods, or services or the holding company’s
reacquiring its outstanding debt.
(2) The holding company is legally released from being
the primary obligor under the liability, either judi-
cially or by the creditor.
Holding companies should aggregate their gains and
losses from the extinguishment of liabilities (debt),
including losses resulting from the payment of prepay-
ment penalties on borrowings such as Federal Home
Loan Bank advances, and consistently report the net
amount in item 7(d), ‘‘Other noninterest expense,’’ of the
Glossary
GL-40
FR Y-9C
Glossary
September 2020

income statement (Schedule HI). Only if a holding
company’s debt extinguishments normally result in net
gains over time should the holding company consistently
report its net gains (losses) in Schedule HI, item 5(l),
‘‘Other noninterest income.’’
In addition, under ASC Subtopic 470-50, Debt – Modiﬁ-
cations and Extinguishments, Issue No. 96-19, the
accounting for the gain or loss on the modiﬁcation or
exchange of debt depends on whether the original and the
new debt instruments are substantially different. If they
are substantially different, the transaction is treated as an
extinguishment of debt and the gain or loss on the
modiﬁcation or exchange is reported immediately in
earnings as discussed in the preceding paragraph. If the
original and new debt instruments are not substantially
different, the gain or loss on the modiﬁcation or replace-
ment of the debt is deferred and recognized over time as
an adjustment to the interest expense on the new borrow-
ing. ASC Subtopic 470-50 provides guidance on how to
determine whether the original and the new debt instru-
ments are substantially different.
Fails: When a holding company or its subsidiaries have
sold an asset and, on settlement date, do not deliver the
security or other asset and do not receive payment, a sales
fail exists. When a holding company or its subsidiaries
have purchased a security or other asset and, on settle-
ment date, do not receive the asset and do not pay for it, a
purchase fail exists. Fails do not affect the way securities
are reported in the FR Y-9C. However, the receivable
from a Fail should be reported in other assets. Likewise a
payable from a Fail should be reported in other liabilities.
Fair Value: ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures, deﬁnes fair value and establishes a
framework for measuring fair value. ASC Topic 820
should be applied when other accounting topics require
or permit fair value measurements. For further informa-
tion, refer to ASC Topic 820.
Fair value is deﬁned as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants in the asset’s or
liability’s principal (or most advantageous) market at the
measurement date. This value is often referred to as an
‘‘exit’’ price. An orderly transaction is a transaction that
assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the
measurement date to allow for marketing activities that
are usual and customary for transactions involving such
assets or liabilities; it is not a forced liquidation or
distressed sale.
ASC Topic 820 establishes a three level fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes inputs used to measure fair
value based on observability. The highest priority is
given to Level 1 (observable, unadjusted) and the lowest
priority to Level 3 (unobservable). The broad principles
for the hierarchy follow.
Level 1 fair value measurement inputs are quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that a holding company has the ability to access
at the measurement date. In addition, a Level 1 fair value
measurement of a liability can also include the quoted
price for an identical liability when traded as an asset in
an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price
of the asset are required.
Level 2 fair value measurement inputs are inputs other
than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. If the asset or liability has a speciﬁed (contrac-
tual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for
substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Depending on the speciﬁc factors related to an asset or a
liability, certain adjustments to Level 2 inputs may be
necessary to determine the fair value of the asset or
liability. If those adjustments are signiﬁcant to the asset
or liability’s fair value in its entirety, the adjustments
may render the fair value measurement to a Level 3
measurement.
Level 3 fair value measurement inputs are unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability. Although these inputs
may not be readily observable in the market, the fair
value measurement objective is, nonetheless, to develop
an exit price for the asset or liability from the perspective
of a market participant. Therefore, Level 3 fair value
measurement inputs should reﬂect the holding com-
pany’s own assumptions about the assumptions that a
market participant would use in pricing an asset or
liability and should be based on the best information
available in the circumstances.
Refer to ASC Topic 820 for additional fair value mea-
surement guidance, including considerations related to
holding large positions (blocks), the existence of multiple
active markets, and the use of practical expedients.

liabilities on the balance sheet - including trading assets
and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, loans held for
sale, assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair
value option, and foreclosed assets - involves the use of
fair values. During periods of market stress, the fair
values of some ﬁnancial instruments and nonﬁnancial
assets may be difficult to determine. Institutions are
reminded that, under such conditions, fair value measure-
ments should be determined consistent with the objective
of fair value set forth in ASC Topic 820.
ASC Topic 820 provides guidance on determining fair
value when the volume and level of activity for an asset
or liability have signiﬁcantly decreased when compared
with normal market activity for the asset or liability (or
similar assets or liabilities). According to ASC Topic
820, if there has been such a signiﬁcant decrease, trans-
actions or quoted prices may not be determinative of fair
value because, for example, there may be increased
instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those
circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted
prices is needed, and a signiﬁcant adjustment to the
transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to esti-
mate fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820.
Federal Funds Transactions: For purposes of the FR Y-
9C, federal funds transactions involve the lending (fed-
eral funds sold) or borrowing (federal funds purchased)
in domestic offices of immediately available funds under
agreements or contracts that have an original maturity of
one business day or roll over under a continuing con-
tract. However, funds lent or borrowed in the form of
securities resale or repurchase agreements, due bills,
borrowings from the Discount and Credit Department of
a Federal Reserve Bank, deposits with and advances
from a Federal Home Loan Bank, and overnight loans for
commercial and industrial purposes are excluded from
federal funds. Transactions that are to be reported as
federal funds transactions may be secured or unsecured
or may involve an agreement to resell loans or other
instruments that are not securities.
Immediately available funds are funds that the purchas-
ing holding company can either use or dispose of on the
same business day that the transaction giving rise to the
receipt or disposal of the funds is executed.
The borrowing and lending of immediately available
funds have an original maturity of one business day if the
funds borrowed on one business day are to be repaid or
the transaction reversed on the next business day, that is,
if immediately available funds borrowed today are to be
repaid tomorrow (in tomorrow’s immediately available
funds). Such transactions include those made on a Friday
to mature or be reversed the following Monday and those
made on the last business day prior to a holiday (for
either or both of the parties to the transaction) to mature
or be reversed on the ﬁrst business day following the
holiday.
A continuing contract is a contract or agreement that
remains in effect for more than one business day but has
no speciﬁed maturity and does not require advance notice
of either party to terminate. Such contracts may also be
known as rollovers or as open-ended agreements.
Federal funds may take the form of the following two
types of transactions in domestic offices provided that the
transactions meet the above criteria (i.e., immediately
available funds with an original maturity of one business
day or under a continuing contract):
(1) Unsecured loans (federal funds sold) or borrowings
(federal funds purchased). (In some market usage,
the term “fed funds” or “pure fed funds” is conﬁned
to unsecured loans of immediately available bal-
ances.)
(2) Purchases (sales) of ﬁnancial assets (other than secu-
rities) under agreements to resell (repurchase) that
have original maturities of one business day (or are
under continuing contracts) and are in immediately
available funds.
Any borrowing or lending of immediately available
funds in domestic offices that has an original maturity of
more than one business day, other than security repur-
chase or resale agreements, is to be treated as a borrow-
ing or as a loan, not as federal funds. Such transactions
are sometimes referred to as ‘‘term federal funds.’’
Federally-Sponsored Lending Agency: A federally-
sponsored lending agency is an agency or corporation
that has been chartered, authorized, or organized as a
result of federal legislation for the purpose of providing
credit services to a designated sector of the economy.
These agencies include Banks for Cooperatives, Federal
Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, Federal
Land Banks, the Federal National Mortgage Association,
and the Student Loan Marketing Association.

Foreclosed Assets: The accounting and reporting stan-
dards for foreclosed assets are set forth in ASC Subtopic
310-20, Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, and ASC
Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Subsequent
to the issuance of FASB Statement No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(the predecessor of ASC Topic 360), AICPA Statement
of Position (SOP) No. 92-3, Accounting for Foreclosed
Assets was rescinded. Certain provisions of SOP 92-3 are
not present in FASB Statement No. 144, but the applica-
tion of these provisions represents prevalent practice in
the banking industry and is consistent with safe and
sound banking practices. These provisions of SOP 92-3
have been incorporated into this Glossary entry, which
holding companies must follow for purposes of preparing
their FR Y-9C reports.
A holding company that receives from a borrower in full
satisfaction of a loan either receivables from a third party,
an equity interest in the borrower, or another type of asset
(except a long-lived asset that will be sold) shall initially
measure the asset received at its fair value at the time of
the restructuring. When a holding company receives a
long-lived asset, such as real estate, from a borrower in
full satisfaction of a loan, the long-lived asset is rebutta-
bly presumed to be held for sale and the holding com-
pany shall initially measure this asset at its fair value less
cost to sell. The fair value (less cost to sell, if applicable)
of the asset received in full satisfaction of the loan
becomes the “cost” of the asset. The amount, if any, by
which the recorded investment in the loan or the amor-
tized cost basis of the loan,12 exceeds the fair value (less
cost to sell, if applicable) of the asset is a loss which must
be charged to the allowance for credit losses on loans and
leases at the time of restructuring, foreclosure, or repos-
session. In those cases where property is received in full
satisfaction of an asset other than a loan (e.g., a debt
security), the loss should be reported on the income
statement in a manner consistent with the balance sheet
classiﬁcation of the asset satisﬁed.
If an asset is sold shortly after it is received in a
restructuring, foreclosure, or repossession, it would gen-
erally be appropriate to substitute the value received in
the sale (net of the cost to sell for a long- lived asset, such
as real estate, that has been sold) for the fair value (less
cost to sell for a long-lived asset, such as real estate, that
will be sold) that had been estimated at the time of
restructuring, foreclosure, or repossession. Any adjust-
ments should be made to the loss charged against the
allowance.
An asset received in partial satisfaction of a loan should
be initially measured as described above and the recorded
investment in the loan should be reduced by the fair value
(less cost to sell, if applicable) of the asset at the time of
restructuring, foreclosure, or repossession.
The measurement and accounting subsequent to acquisi-
tion for real estate received in full or partial satisfaction
of a loan, including through foreclosure or repossession,
is discussed below in this Glossary entry. For other types
of assets that a holding company receives in full or partial
satisfaction of a loan, the holding company generally
should subsequently measure and account for such assets
in accordance with other applicable generally accepted
accounting principles and regulatory reporting instruc-
tions for such assets.
For purposes of this report, foreclosed assets (other than
real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage
loan) include loans where the holding company, as
creditor, has received physical possession of a borrower’s
assets, regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceed-
ings take place. A holding company, as creditor, is
considered to have received physical possession of resi-
dential real estate property collateralizing a consumer
mortgage loan only upon the occurrence of either of the
following:
a. The holding company obtains legal title to the
residential real estate property upon completion of a
foreclosure even if the borrower has redemption
rights whereby they have a legal right for a period
of time after a foreclosure to reclaim the real estate
property by paying certain amounts speciﬁed by
law.
b. The borrower conveys all interest in the residential
real estate property to the bank to satisfy the loan
through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure
or through a similar legal agreement. The deed in
lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement is
completed when agreed-upon terms and conditions
12. The recorded investment in the loan is the loan balance adjusted for
any unamortized premium or discount and unamortized loan fees or costs,
less any amount previously charged off, plus recorded accrued interest. For
holding companies that have adopted ASC Topic 326, the term “amortized
cost basis” is used in place of “recorded investment.” See the Glossary
entry for “Amortized Cost Basis.”

have been satisﬁed by both the borrower and the
creditor.13
In such situations, the secured loan should be recatego-
rized on the balance sheet in the asset category appropri-
ate to the underlying collateral (e.g., as other real estate
owned for real estate collateral) and accounted for as
described above.
The amount of any senior debt (principal and accrued
interest) to which foreclosed real estate is subject at the
time of foreclosure must be reported as a liability in
Schedule HC, items 16, “Other borrowed money.”
After foreclosure, each foreclosed real estate asset (includ-
ing any real estate for which the holding company
receives physical possession,) must be carried at the
lower of (1) the fair value of the asset minus the
estimated costs to sell the asset or (2) the cost of the asset
(as deﬁned in the preceding paragraphs). This determina-
tion must be made on an asset-by-asset basis. If the fair
value of a foreclosed real estate asset minus the estimated
costs to sell the asset is less than the asset’s cost, the
deﬁciency must be recognized as a valuation allowance
against the asset which is created through a charge to
expense. The valuation allowance should thereafter be
increased or decreased (but not below zero) through
charges or credits to expense for changes in the asset’s
fair value or estimated selling costs.
If a foreclosed real estate asset is held for more than a
short period of time, any declines after foreclosure in the
asset’s fair value minus the estimated costs to sell,
subsequent recoveries of such declines, and any gain or
loss from the sale or disposition of the asset shall not be
reported as credit loss or recovery and shall not be
debited or credited to the allowance for credit losses on
loans and leases. Such declines in value and subsequent
recoveries of such declines, which are recognized through
increases and decreases in a valuation allowance, the
gain or loss from the sale or disposition shall be reported
net on the income statement in Schedule HI, item 5(J)
“Net gains (losses) on sales of other real estate owned.”
Reporting Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage
Loans upon Foreclosure—ASC Subtopic 310-20 clariﬁes
the conditions under which a creditor must derecognize a
government-guaranteed mortgage loan and recognize a
separate “other receivable” upon foreclosure (that is,
when a creditor receives physical possession of real
estate property collateralizing a mortgage loan). When
these conditions are met, other real estate owned should
not be recognized by a holding company. A holding
company should derecognize a mortgage loan and record
a separate other receivable upon foreclosure of the real
estate collateral if all of the following conditions are met:
• The loan has a government guarantee that is not
separable from the loan before foreclosure.
• At the time of foreclosure, the holding company has
the intent to convey the property to the guarantor and
make a claim on the guarantee and it has the ability to
recover under that claim.
• At the time of foreclosure, any amount of the claim that
is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real
estate is ﬁxed (that is, the real estate property has been
appraised for purposes of the claim and thus the
holding company is not exposed to changes in the fair
value of the property).
This guidance is applicable to fully and partially
government-guaranteed mortgage loans provided the
three conditions identiﬁed above have been met. In such
situations, upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable
should be measured based on the amount of the loan
balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered
from the guarantor. This other receivable should be
reported in Schedule HC-F, item 6, “All other assets.”
Any interest income earned on the other receivable
should be reported in Schedule HI, item 1(g), “Other
interest income.”
Accounting under ASC Subtopic 610-20 (and ASC
Topic 606). Under ASC Subtopic 610-20, if the buyer of
the OREO is a legal entity, a holding company should
ﬁrst assess whether it has a controlling ﬁnancial interest
in the legal entity buying the OREO by applying the
guidance in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. If holding
company determines that it has a controlling ﬁnancial
interest in the buying legal entity, it should not derecog-

ning of the annual period for which the amendments are effective.

Subtopic 810-10. When a holding company does not
have a controlling ﬁnancial interest in the buying legal
entity or the OREO buyer is not a legal entity, which is
expected to be the case for most sales of OREO, the
holding company will recognize the entire gain or loss, if
any, and derecognize the OREO at the time of sale if the
transaction meets certain requirements of ASC Topic
606. Otherwise, the holding company generally will
continue reporting the OREO as an asset, with any cash
payments or other consideration received from the indi-
vidual or entity acquiring the OREO (i.e., any down
payment and any subsequent payments of principal or
interest) reported as a liability in Schedule HC-G, item 4,
“All other liabilities,” until it becomes appropriate to
recognize the revenue and the sale of the OREO in
accordance with ASC Subtopic 610-20 and ASC
Topic 606.14
When applying ASC Subtopic 610-20 and Topic 606,
holding companies will need to exercise judgment in
determining whether a contract (within the meaning of
Topic 606) exists for the sale or transfer of OREO,
whether the holding company has performed its obliga-
tions identiﬁed in the contract, and what the transaction
price is for calculation of the amount of gain or loss.
These standards apply to all sales or transfers of real
estate by holding companies, but greater judgment will
generally be required for seller-ﬁnanced sales of OREO.
Under ASC Subtopic 610-20, when a holding company
does not have a controlling ﬁnancial interest in the
buying legal entity or the OREO buyer is not a legal
entity, the holding company’s ﬁrst step in assessing
whether it can derecognize an OREO asset and recognize
revenue upon the sale or transfer of the OREO is to
determine whether a contract exists under the provisions
of Topic 606. In the context of an OREO sale or transfer,
in order for a holding company’s transaction with the
party acquiring the property to be a contract under ASC
Topic 606, it must meet all the following criteria:
(a) The parties to the contract have approved the
contract (in writing, orally, or in accordance with
other customary business practices) and are com-
mitted to perform their respective obligations;
(b) The holding company can identify each party’s
rights regarding the OREO to be transferred;
(c) The holding company can identify the payment
terms for the OREO to be transferred;
(d) The contract has commercial substance (that is,
the risk, timing, or amount of the holding com-
pany’s future cash ﬂows is expected to change as
a result of the contract); and
(e) It is probable that the holding company will
collect substantially all of the consideration to
which it will be entitled in exchange for OREO
that will be transferred to the buyer, i.e. the
transaction price. In evaluating whether collect-
ability of an amount of consideration is probable,
a holding company shall consider only the buy-
er’s ability and intention to pay that amount of
consideration when it is due.
These ﬁve criteria require careful analysis for seller-
ﬁnanced sales of OREO. In particular, criteria (a) and (e)
may require signiﬁcant judgment. When determining
whether the buyer is committed to perform its obligations
under criterion (a) and collectability under criterion (e), a
selling holding company should consider all facts and
circumstances related to the buyer’s ability and intent to
pay the transaction price, which may include:
• Amount of cash paid as a down payment;
• Existence of recourse provisions;
• Credit standing of the buyer;
• Age and location of the property;
• Cash ﬂow from the property;
• Payments by the buyer to third parties;
• Other amounts paid to the selling holding company,
including current or future contingent payments;
• Transfer of noncustomary consideration (i.e., consider-
ation other than cash and a note receivable);
• Other types of ﬁnancing involved with the property or
transaction;
• Financing terms of the loan (reasonable and customary
terms, amortization, any graduated payments, any bal-
loon payment);
14. Although ASC Topic 606 describes the consideration received
(including any cash payments) using such terms as “liability,” “deposit,”
and “deposit liability,” for regulatory reporting purposes these amounts
should be reported in Schedule HC-G, item 4, and not as a deposit in
Schedule HC, item 13.

• Underwriting inconsistent with the holding company’s
underwriting policies for loans not involving OREO
sales; and
• Future subordination of the selling holding company’s
receivable.
The amount and character of a buyer’s equity (typically
the down payment) and recourse provisions remain
important factors under ASC Subtopic 610-20 when
evaluating criteria (a) and (e). Speciﬁcally, the buyer’s
initial equity in the property immediately after the sale is
an important consideration in determining whether a
buyer is committed to perform its obligations under
criterion (a). Furthermore, the buyer’s initial equity is a
factor to consider under criterion (e) when evaluating the
collectability of consideration that the holding company
is entitled to receive from the buyer.
In applying the revenue recognition principles in ASC
Topic 606, all relevant factors are to be weighed collec-
tively in evaluating whether the ﬁve contract criteria have
been met as the ﬁrst step in determining the appropriate
accounting for a seller-ﬁnanced OREO transaction. How-
ever, the agencies consider the down payment and ﬁnanc-
ing terms to be of particular importance when making
this determination. A transaction with an insigniﬁcant
down payment and nonrecourse ﬁnancing generally
would not meet the deﬁnition of a contract (within the
meaning of Topic 606) unless there is considerable
support from other factors. The need for support from
other factors recedes in importance for a transaction with
a substantial down payment and recourse ﬁnancing to a
buyer with adequate capacity to repay.
If the ﬁve contract criteria in ASC Topic 606 have not
been met, the holding company generally may not derec-
ognize the OREO asset or recognize revenue (gain or
loss) as an accounting sale has not occurred. The holding
company should continue to assess the transaction to
determine whether the contract criteria have been met in
a later period. Until that time, any consideration the
holding company has received from the buyer should
generally be recorded as a deposit liability. In addition, if
the transaction price is less than the carrying amount of
the OREO, the holding company should consider whether
this indicates a decline in fair value of the OREO that
should be recognized as a valuation allowance, or an
increase in an existing valuation allowance, and through
a charge to expense as discussed above in this Glossary
entry.
If a holding company determines the contract criteria in
ASC Topic 606 have been met, it must then determine
whether it has satisﬁed its performance obligations as
identiﬁed in the contract by transferring control of the
asset to the buyer. Control of an asset refers to the ability
to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the
remaining beneﬁts from, the asset. As it relates to a
holding company’s sale of OREO, ASC Topic 606
includes the following indicators of the transfer of con-
trol:
(a) The holding company has a present right to
payment for the asset;
(b) The buyer has legal title to the asset;
(c) The holding company has transferred physical
possession of the asset;
(d) The buyer has the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset; and
(e) The buyer has accepted the asset.
For seller-ﬁnanced sales of OREO, the transfer of control
generally occurs on the closing date of the sale when the
holding company obtains the right to receive payment for
the property and transfers legal title to the buyer. How-
ever, a holding company must consider all relevant facts
and circumstances to determine whether control of the
OREO has transferred, which may include the selling
holding company’s:
• Involvement with the property following the transac-
tion;
• Obligation to repurchase the property in the future;
• Obligation to provide support for the property follow-
ing the sale transaction; and
• Retention of an equity interest in the property.
In particular, if a holding company has the obligation or
right to repurchase the OREO, the buyer does not obtain
control of the OREO because the buyer is limited in its
ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of
the remaining beneﬁts from, the asset even though it may
have physical possession. In this situation, a holding
company should account for the contract as either (1) a
lease in accordance with Topic 842, Leases or (2) a
ﬁnancing arrangement in accordance with ASC Topic
606. In addition, situations may exist where the selling
holding company has legal title to the OREO, while the
Glossary

borrower whose property was foreclosed upon under the
original loan still has redemption rights to reclaim the
property in the future. If such redemption rights exist, the
selling holding company may not be able to transfer
control to the buyer of the OREO and recognize revenue
until the redemption period expires.
When a contract exists and a holding company has
transferred control of the property, the holding company
should derecognize the OREO asset and recognize a gain
or loss for the difference between the transaction price
and the carrying amount of the OREO asset. Generally,
the transaction price in a sale of OREO will be the
contract amount in the purchase/sale agreement, includ-
ing for a seller-ﬁnanced sale ﬁnanced at market terms.
However, the transaction price may differ from the
amount stated in the contract due to the existence of a
signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component. Under the new stan-
dard, a signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component exists if the
timing of the buyer’s payments explicitly or implicitly
provides the selling holding company or the buyer with a
signiﬁcant beneﬁt of ﬁnancing the transfer of the OREO.
A seller-ﬁnanced transaction of OREO at off-market
terms generally indicates the existence of a signiﬁcant
ﬁnancing component. If a signiﬁcant ﬁnancing compo-
nent exists, the contract amount should be adjusted for
the time value of money to reﬂect what the cash selling
price of the OREO would have been at the time of its
transfer to the buyer. The discount rate used in adjusting
for the time value of money should be a market rate of
interest considering the credit characteristics of the buyer
and the terms of the ﬁnancing.
Foreign Banks: See ‘‘Banks, U.S. and foreign.’’
Foreign Central Banks: The term ‘‘foreign central
banks’’ covers: central banks in foreign countries; depart-
ments of foreign central governments that have, as an
important part of their functions, activities similar to
those of a central bank; nationalized banks and banking
institutions owned by central governments that have, as
an important part of their functions, activities similar to
those of a central bank; and the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS).
Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation: For-
eign currency transactions are transactions occurring in
the ordinary course of business (e.g., purchases, sales,
borrowings, lendings, forward exchange contracts)
denominated in currencies other than the office’s func-
tional currency (as described below).
Foreign currency translation, on the other hand, is the
process of translating ﬁnancial statements from the for-
eign office’s functional currency into the reporting cur-
rency. Such translation normally is performed only at
reporting dates.
A functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which an office operates. For
most consolidated holding companies, the functional
currency will be the U.S. dollar. However, if a consoli-
dated holding company has foreign offices, one or more
foreign offices may have a functional currency other than
the U.S. dollar.
Accounting for foreign currency transactions—A change
in exchange rates between the functional currency and
the currency in which a transaction is denominated will
increase or decrease the amount of the functional cur-
rency expected to be received or paid. These increases or
decreases in the expected functional currency cash ﬂow
are to be reported as foreign currency transaction gains
and losses and are to be included in the determination of
the income of the period in which the transaction takes
place, or if the transaction has not yet settled, the period
in which the rate change takes place.
Except for foreign currency derivatives and transactions
described in the following section, holding companies
should consistently report net gains (losses) from foreign
currency transactions other than trading transactions in
Schedule HI, item 5(l), ‘‘Other noninterest income,’’ or
item 7(d), ‘‘Other noninterest expense.’’ Net gains (losses)
from foreign currency trading transactions should be
reported in Schedule HI, item 5(c), ‘‘Trading revenue.’’
Foreign currency transaction gains or losses to be
excluded from the determination of net income—Gains
and losses on the following foreign currency transactions
shall not be included in ‘‘Noninterest income’’ or ‘‘Non-
interest expense,’’ but shall be reported in the same
manner as translation adjustments (as described below):
(1) Foreign currency transactions that are designated as,
and are effective as, economic hedges of a net
investment in a foreign office.
(2) Intercompany foreign currency transactions that are
of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is
not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future),
when the parties to the transaction are consolidated,
combined, or accounted for by the equity method in
the holding company’s FR Y-9C.

In addition, the entire change in the fair value of foreign-
currency-denominated available-for-sale debt securities
should not be included in ‘‘Realized gains (losses) on
available-for-sale debt securities’’ (Schedule HI, item
6(b)), but should be reported in Schedule HI-A, item 12,
‘‘Other comprehensive income.’’ These fair value changes
should be accumulated in the ‘‘Net unrealized holding
gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities’’ compo-
nent of ‘‘Accumulated other comprehensive income’’ in
Schedule HC, item 26(b). However, if a decline in fair
value of a foreign-currency-denominated available-for-
sale debt security is judged to be other than temporary,
the cost basis of the individual security shall be written
down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of
the write-down shall be included in earnings (Schedule
HI, item 6(b)).
See the Glossary entry for “Derivative Contracts” for
information on the accounting and reporting for foreign
currency derivatives.
Accounting for foreign currency translation (applicable
only to holding companies with foreign offıces)— The FR
Y-9C must be reported in U.S. dollars. Balances of
foreign subsidiaries or branches of the reporting holding
company denominated in a functional currency other
than U.S. dollars shall be converted to U.S. dollar equiva-
lents and consolidated into the reporting holding com-
pany’s FR Y-9C. The translation adjustments for each
reporting period, determined utilizing the current rate
method, may be reported in ‘‘Other comprehensive
income’’ in Schedule HI-A of the Report of Income for
Holding Companies. Amounts accumulated in the ‘‘Accu-
mulated other comprehensive income’’ component of
equity capital in Schedule HC will not be included in the
holding company’s results of operations until such time
as the foreign office is disposed of, when they will be
used as an element to determine the gain or loss on
disposition.
For further guidance, refer to ASC Topic 830, Foreign
Currency Matters (formerly FASB Statement No. 52,
Foreign Currency Translation).
Foreign Debt Exchange Transactions: Foreign debt
exchange transactions generally fall into three categories:
(1) loan swaps, (2) debt/equity swaps, and (3) debt-for-
development swaps. These transactions are to be reported
in the FR Y-9C in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles as summarized below. The account-
ing pronouncements mentioned below should be con-
sulted for more detailed reporting guidance in these
areas.
Generally accepted accounting principles require that
these transactions be reported at their fair value. There is
a signiﬁcant amount of precedent in the accounting for
exchange transactions to consider both the fair value of
the consideration given up as well as the fair value of the
assets received in arriving at the most informed valua-
tion, especially if the value of the consideration given up
is not readily determinable or may not be a good indica-
tor of the value received. It is the responsibility of
management to make the valuation considering all of the
circumstances. Such valuations are subject to examiner
review.
Among the factors to consider in determining fair values
for foreign debt exchange transactions are:
(1) Similar transactions for cash;
(2) Estimated cash ﬂows from the debt or equity instru-
ments or other assets received;
(3) Market values, if any, of similar instruments; and
(4) Currency restrictions, if any, affecting payments on
or sales of the debt or equity instruments, local
currency, or other assets received, including where
appropriate those affecting the repatriation of capital.
Losses arise from swap transactions when the fair value
determined for the transaction is less than the recorded
investment in the sovereign debt and other consideration
paid, if any. Such losses should generally be charged to
the allowance for credit losses, (or allocated transfer risk
reserve, if appropriate) and must include any discounts
from official exchange rates that are imposed by sover-
eign obligors as transaction fees. All other fees and
transaction costs involved in such transactions must be
charged to expense as incurred.
Loss recoveries or even gains might be indicated in a
swap transaction as a result of the valuation process.
However, due to the subjective nature of the valuation
process, such loss recoveries or gains ordinarily should
not be recorded until the debt or equity instruments,
local currency, or other assets received in the exchange
transaction are realized in unrestricted cash or cash
equivalents.
Loan swaps—Foreign loan swaps, or debt/debt swaps,
involve the exchange of one foreign loan for another.
Glossary

This type of transaction represents an exchange of mone-
tary assets that must be reported at current fair value.
Normally, when monetary assets are exchanged, with or
without additional cash payments, and the parties have
no remaining obligations to each other, the earnings
process is complete.
Debt/equity swaps—The reporting treatment for this type
of transaction is presented in the ASC Subtopic 942-310,
Financial Services-Depository and Lending – Receiv-
ables.
A foreign debt/equity swap represents an exchange of
monetary for nonmonetary assets that must be measured
at fair value. This type of swap is typically accomplished
when holders of U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt
agree to convert that debt into approved local equity
investments. The holders are generally credited with
local currency at the official exchange rate. A discount
from the official exchange rate is often imposed as a
transaction fee. The local currency is generally not
available to the holders for any purposes other than
approved equity investments. Restrictions may be placed
on dividends on the equity investments and capital
usually cannot be repatriated for several years.
In arriving at the fair value of the transaction, both the
secondary market price of the debt given up and the fair
value of the equity investment or assets received should
be considered.
Debt-for-development swaps—In this type of exchange,
sovereign debt held by a holding company is generally
purchased by a nonproﬁt organization or contributed to
the nonproﬁt the nonproﬁt organization. When the sover-
eign debt is purchased by or donated to a nonproﬁt
organization, the organization may enter into an agree-
ment with the debtor country to cancel the debt in return
for the country’s commitment to provide local currency
or other assets for use in connection with speciﬁc projects
or programs in that country. Alternatively, a holding
company may exchange the sovereign debt with the
country and receive local currency. In this alternative, the
local currency will be donated or sold to the nonproﬁt
organization for use in connection with speciﬁc projects
or programs in that country.
These transactions, including amounts charged to expense
as donations, must be reported at their fair values in
accordance with generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples applicable to foreign debt exchange transactions.
This includes appropriate consideration of the market
value of the instruments involved in the transaction and
the fair value of any assets received, taking into account
any restrictions that would limit the use of the assets. In
debt-for-development swaps where a holding company
receives local currency in exchange for the sovereign
loan it held and the local currency has no restrictions on
its use and is freely convertible, it is generally appropri-
ate for fair value to be determined by valuing the local
currency received at its fair market exchange value.
Foreign Governments and Official Institutions: For-
eign governments and official institutions are central,
state, provincial, and local governments in foreign coun-
tries and their ministries, departments, and agencies.
These include treasuries, ministries of ﬁnance, central
banks, development banks, exchange control offices, sta-
bilization funds, diplomatic establishments, ﬁscal agents,
and nationalized banks and other banking institutions that
are owned by central governments and that have as an
important part of their function activities similar to those
of a treasury, central bank, exchange control office, or
stabilization fund. For purposes of these reports, other
government-owned enterprises are not included.
Also included as foreign official institutions are interna-
tional, regional, and treaty organizations, such as the
International Monetary Fund, the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), the
Bank for International Settlements, the Inter-American
Development Bank, and the United Nations.
Foreign Office: For purposes of these reports, a foreign
office of the reporting holding company is a branch or
consolidated subsidiary located in a foreign country; an
Edge or Agreement subsidiary, including both its U.S.
and its foreign offices; or an IBF. In addition, if the
reporting holding company is chartered and headquar-
tered in the 50 states of the United States and the District
of Columbia, a branch or consolidated subsidiary located
in Puerto Rico or a U.S. territory or possession is a
foreign office. Branches of bank subsidiaries on U.S.
military facilities wherever located are treated as domes-
tic offices, not foreign offices.
Forward Contract: See ‘‘Futures, forward, and standby
contracts.’’

actions and translation.’’

delivery of ﬁnancial instruments or commodities in which
the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to
make delivery, at a speciﬁed future date, of a speciﬁed
instrument at a speciﬁed price or yield.
Futures contracts are standardized and are traded on
organized exchanges. Exchanges in the U.S. are registered
with and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. Forward contracts are traded over the coun-
ter and their terms are not standardized. Such contracts can
only be terminated, other than by receipt of the underlying
ﬁnancial instrument or commodity, by agreement of both
buyer and seller. Standby contracts and other option
arrangements are optional forward contracts. The buyer of
such a contract has, for compensation (such as a fee or
premium), acquired the right (or option) to sell to, or
purchase from, another party some ﬁnancial instrument or
commodity at a stated price on a speciﬁed future date. The
seller of the contract has, for such compensation, become
obligated to purchase or sell the ﬁnancial instrument or
commodity at the option of the buyer of the contract. Such
contracts may relate to purchases or sales of securities,
money market instruments, or futures contracts.
A standby contract or put option is an optional delivery
forward placement contract. It obligates the seller of the
contract to purchase some ﬁnancial instrument at the
option of the buyer of the contract.
A call option is an optional forward purchase contract. It
obligates the seller of the contract to sell some ﬁnancial
instrument at the option of the buyer of the contract.
FR Y-9C treatment of open contracts—Contracts are
outstanding (i.e., open) until they have been terminated
by acquisition or delivery of the underlying ﬁnancial
instruments or, for futures contracts, by offset, or, for
standby contracts and other option arrangements, by
expiring unexercised. (‘‘Offset’’ is the purchase and sale
of an equal number of futures contracts on the same
underlying instrument for the same delivery month
executed through the same broker or dealer and executed
on the same exchange.)
The reporting of these contracts should follow the
accounting outlined in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and
Hedging (formerly FAS 133) and disclosed in Schedule
HC-L.
Goodwill: According to ASC Topic 805, Business Com-
binations, goodwill is an asset representing the future
economic beneﬁts arising from other assets acquired in a
business combination that are not individually identiﬁed
and separately recognized. The private company account-
ing alternative for identiﬁable intangible assets acquired
in a business combination is discussed in a subsection of
this Glossary entry. In addition, see “Acquisition Method”
in the Glossary entry for “Business Combinations” for
guidance on the recognition and initial measurement of
goodwill acquired in a business combination.
Subsequent Measurement of Goodwill - Goodwill should
not be amortized, but must be tested for impairment at the
reporting unit level at least annually, unless a holding
company meets the deﬁnition of a private company, as
deﬁned in U.S. GAAP, and elects either or both of the
goodwill accounting alternatives described below. Any
impairment losses recognized on goodwill during the
year-to-date reporting period should be reported in
Schedule HI, item 7(c)(1), ‘‘Goodwill impairment losses,’’
except those impairment losses associated with discontin-
ued operations, which should be reported on a net-of-tax
basis in Schedule HI, item 11. Goodwill, net of any
impairment losses, should be reported on the balance
sheet in Schedule HC, item 10 and in Schedule HC-M,
item 12.b.
Private Company Accounting Alternatives for Goodwill -
ASC Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other –
Goodwill generally permits a private company, as deﬁned
in U.S. GAAP, to elect an accounting alternative for
goodwill under which goodwill is amortized on a straight-
line basis over a period of ten years (or less than ten years
if more appropriate) and a simpliﬁed impairment model
is applied to goodwill. In addition, if a private company
chooses to adopt this goodwill accounting alternative, the
private company is required to make an accounting
policy election to test goodwill for impairment at either
the entity level or the reporting unit level. Goodwill must
be tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs
that indicates that the fair value of an entity or a reporting
unit, as appropriate under this private company’s account-
ing policy election, may be below its carrying amount.
Alternatively, ASC Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles - Good-
will and Other - Goodwill, as amended by ASU 2021-03,
“Accounting Alternative for Evaluating Triggering
Events,” allows a private company to elect to evaluate
goodwill, at each reporting date instead of the require-
ment to monitor goodwill impairment triggering events
during the reporting period. Private companies that elect
the triggering event alternative evaluate the facts and
circumstances at the end of each reporting period to
Glossary
GL-50
FR Y-9C
Glossary
June 2021

determine whether a triggering event exists, and if so,
whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is
impaired.
U.S. GAAP for a public business entity does not permit
goodwill to be amortized, instead requiring goodwill to
be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level
annually and between annual tests in certain circum-
stances. For information on the distinction between a
private company and a public business entity, see the
Glossary entry for “Public Business Entity.”
A holding company that meets the deﬁnition of a private
company is permitted, but not required, to adopt the
private company accounting alternatives for goodwill. If
a private company issues U.S. GAAP ﬁnancial statements
and chooses to adopt either or both private company
alternatives, it should apply the goodwill accounting
alternative(s) in its FR Y-9C in a manner consistent with
its reporting of goodwill in its ﬁnancial statements.
Goodwill amortization expense should be reported in
item 7.c.(1) of the FR Y-9C Report income statement
(Schedule HI) unless the amortization is associated with
a discontinued operation, in which case the goodwill
amortization should be included within the results of
discontinued operations and reported in Schedule HI,
item 11.
Goodwill Impairment Testing - ASC Subtopic 350-20,
provides guidance for testing and reporting goodwill
impairment losses, a summary of which follows. Impair-
ment is the condition that exists when the carrying
amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
Because the fair value of goodwill can be measured only
as a residual and cannot be measured directly, ASC
Subtopic 350-20 includes a methodology for estimating
the implied fair value of goodwill for impairment mea-
surement purposes.
The holding company’s goodwill must be tested for
impairment using the holding company’s reporting units
(unless the holding company is a private company that
has elected the goodwill accounting alternative and has
made an accounting policy election to test goodwill for
impairment at the entity level). Goodwill should be
assigned to reporting units in accordance with ASC
Subtopic 350-20. The holding company itself may be a
reporting unit.
Unless it is a holding company that is a private company
that has elected either or both goodwill alternatives
desicribed above, goodwill of a reporting unit must be
tested for impairment annually and between annual tests
upon the occurance of a triggering event, i.e., if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount. Examples of triggering events or cir-
cumstances include a signiﬁcant adverse change in the
business climate, unanticipated competition, a loss of key
personnel, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a
reporting unit or a signiﬁcant portion of a reporting unit
will be sold or otherwise disposed of. In addition,
goodwill must be tested for impairment after a portion of
goodwill has been allocated to a business to be dis-
posed of.
When testing the goodwill of a reporting unit15 for
impairment, an institution has the option of ﬁrst assessing
qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to
perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment
test described in ASC Subtopic 350-20. If determined to
be necessary, the twostep impairment test shall be used to
identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the
amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized
(if any). However, an institution may choose to bypass
the qualitative assessment option for any reporting unit in
any period and proceed directly to performing the two-
step quantitative goodwill impairment test described
below.
Qualitative Assessment - If an institution performs a
qualitative assessment and, after considering all relevant
events and circumstances, determines it is not more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than its carrying amount (including goodwill), then the
institution does not need to perform the two-step quanti-
tative goodwill impairment test. In other words, if it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit
is greater than its carrying amount; an institution would
not have to quantitatively test the unit’s goodwill for
impairment. However, if the institution instead concludes
that the opposite is true (that is, it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount), then it is required to perform the
15. For purposes of the discussions of goodwill impairment testing, the
qualitative assessment, and the quantitative impairment test, if a holding
company is a private company that has elected the goodwill accounting
alternative and also has elected to test goodwill for impairment at the entity
level, references to the reporting unit should be read as references to the
entity.

two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test described
below.
ASC Subtopic 350-20 includes examples of events and
circumstances that an institution should consider in
evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair
value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
Because the examples are not all-inclusive, other relevant
events and circumstances also must be considered.
Quantitative Impairment Test -
• Step 1: The ﬁrst step of the goodwill impairment test
compares the fair value of a reporting unit16 with its
carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying
amount of a reporting unit is greater than zero17 and its
fair value exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting
unit’s goodwill is considered not impaired and the
second step of the impairment test is unnecessary.
However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill
impairment test must be performed to measure the
amount of impairment loss, if any.
• Step 2: The second step of the goodwill impairment
test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
unit’s goodwill18 with the carrying amount of that
goodwill. If the implied fair value of the reporting
unit’s goodwill exceeds the carrying amount of that
goodwill, the goodwill is considered not impaired. In
contrast, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that good-
will, an impairment loss must be recognized in earn-
ings in an amount equal to that excess. The loss
recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the
reporting unit’s goodwill.
After an impairment loss is recognized on a reporting
unit’s goodwill, the adjusted carrying amount of that
goodwill (i.e., the carrying amount of the goodwill before
recognizing the impairment loss less the amount of the
impairment loss) shall be its new accounting basis.
Subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill
impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of
that loss is completed.
Disposal of a Reporting Unit or a Business - When a
reporting unit is to be disposed of in its entirety, goodwill
of that reporting unit (or a portion of the entity if the
institution is a private company that has elected the
goodwill accounting alternative and also has elected to
test goodwill for impairment at the entity level) must be
included in the carrying amount of the reporting unit
when determining the gain or loss on disposal. When a
portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to
be disposed of, goodwill associated with that business
must be included in the carrying amount of the business
in determining the gain or loss on disposal. Otherwise, an
institution may not remove goodwill from its balance
sheet, for example, by “selling” or “dividending” this
asset to its parent holding company or another affiliate.
Accounting by Private Companies for Identiﬁable Intan-
gible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination – ASC
Subtopic 805-20, Business Combinations – Identiﬁable
Assets and Liabilities, and Any Noncontrolling Interest,
provides an accounting alternative that permits a private
company, as deﬁned in U.S. GAAP, to simplify the
accounting for certain intangible assets. This accounting
alternative applies when a private company is required to
recognize or otherwise consider the fair value of intan-
gible assets as a result of certain transactions, including
when applying the acquisition method to a business
combination under ASC Topic 805. A private company
that elects the accounting alternative for identiﬁable
intangible assets should no longer recognize separately
from goodwill:
• Customer-related intangible assets unless they are
capable of being sold or licensed independently from
the other assets of a business, and
• Noncompetition agreements.
However, because mortgage servicing rights and core
deposit intangibles are regarded as capable of being sold
or licensed independently, a private company that elects
this accounting alternative must recognize these intan-
gible assets separately from goodwill, initially measure
16. The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received
to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date.
17. An institution should refer ASC Subtopic 350-20 for guidance on
applying the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of a
reporting unit is zero or negative.
18. The implied fair value of goodwill should be determined in the
same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combina-
tion is determined. That is, an institution must assign the fair value of a
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any
unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination.

them at fair value, and subsequently measure them in
accordance with ASC Topic 350.
A private company that elects the accounting alternative
for identiﬁable intangible assets in ASC Subtopic 805-20
also must adopt the private company goodwill account-
ing alternative in ASC Subtopic 350-20, which is
described above in this Glossary entry. However, a
private company that elects the goodwill accounting
alternative in ASC Subtopic 350-20 is not required to
adopt the accounting alternative for identiﬁable intan-
gible assets.
A private company’s decision to adopt the accounting
alternative for identiﬁable intangible assets must be made
upon the occurrence of the ﬁrst business combination (or
other transaction within the scope of the alternative) in
ﬁscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The
effective date of the private company’s decision to adopt
the accounting alternative for identiﬁable intangible
assets depends on the timing of that ﬁrst transaction as
described in the applicable transition guidance in ASC
Subtopic 805-20.19 Customer-related intangible assets
and noncompetition agreements that exist as of the
beginning of the period of adoption should continue to be
accounted for separately from goodwill, i.e., such exist-
ing intangible assets should not be combined with good-
will.
If a holding company that is a private company issues
U.S. GAAP ﬁnancial statements and adopts the account-
ing alternative for identiﬁable intangible assets, it should
apply this accounting alternative in its FR Y-9C report in
a manner consistent with its reporting of intangible assets
in its ﬁnancial statements.
Hypothecated Deposit: A hypothecated deposit is the
aggregation of periodic payments on an installment con-
tract received by a reporting institution in a state in
which, under law, such payments are not immediately
used to reduce the unpaid balance of the installment note,
but are accumulated until the sum of the payments equals
the entire amount of principal and interest on the con-
tract, at which time the loan is considered paid in full. For
purposes of these reports, hypothecated deposits are to be
netted against the related loans. Deposits which simply
serve as collateral for loans are not considered hypoth-
ecated deposits for purposes of these reports.
See also: ‘‘Deposits.’’
IBF: See ‘‘International Banking Facility (IBF).’’
Income Taxes: All holding companies, regardless of
size, are required to report income taxes (federal, state
and local, and foreign) in the FR Y-9C on an accrual
basis. Note that, in almost all cases, applicable income
taxes as reported in Schedule HI on the Report of Income
for Holding Companies will differ from amounts reported
to taxing authorities. The applicable income tax expense
or beneﬁt that is reﬂected in the Report of Income for
Holding Companies should include both taxes currently
paid or payable (or receivable) and deferred income
taxes. The following discussion of income taxes is based
on ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
Applicable income taxes in the year-end Report of
Income for Holding Companies shall be the sum of the
following:
(1) Taxes currently paid or payable (or receivable) for
the year determined from the holding company’s
federal, state, and local income tax returns for that
year. Since the holding company’s tax returns will
not normally be prepared until after the year-end FR
Y-9C has been completed, the holding company
must estimate the amount of the current income tax
liability (or receivable) that will ultimately be reported
on its tax returns. Estimation of this liability (or
receivable) may involve consultation with the hold-
ing company’s tax advisers, a review of the previous
year’s tax returns, the identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant
expected differences between items of income and
expense reﬂected on the Report of Income for Hold-
ing Companies and on the tax returns, and the
identiﬁcation of expected tax credits.)
and
(2) Deferred income tax expense or beneﬁt measured as
the change in the net deferred tax assets or liabilities
for the period reported. Deferred tax liabilities and
assets represent the amount by which taxes payable
(or receivable) are expected to increase or decrease in
19. If the ﬁrst transaction occurs in the private company’s ﬁrst ﬁscal
year beginning after December 15, 2015, the adoption of the accounting
alternative will be effective for that ﬁscal year’s annual ﬁnancial reporting
period and all interim and annual periods thereafter. If the ﬁrst transaction
occurs in a ﬁscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, the adoption of
the accounting alternative will be effective in the interim period that
includes the date of the transaction and subsequent interim and annual
periods thereafter. Early application of the intangibles accounting alterna-
tive is permitted for any annual or interim period for which a private
company’s ﬁnancial statements have not yet been made available for
issuance.

the future as a result of ‘‘temporary differences’’ and
net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that
exist at the reporting date.
The actual tax liability (or receivable) calculated on the
holding company’s tax returns may differ from the esti-
mate reported as currently payable or receivable on the
year-end Report of Income for Holding Companies. An
amendment to the holding company’s year-end and sub-
sequent FR Y-9Cs may be appropriate if the difference is
signiﬁcant. Minor differences should be handled as accrual
adjustments to applicable income taxes in Reports of
Income during the year the differences are detected. The
reporting of applicable income taxes in the Report of
Income for Holding Companies for report dates other than
year-end is discussed below under ‘‘interim period appli-
cable income taxes.’’
When determining the current and deferred income tax
assets and liabilities to be reported in any period, a holding
company’s income tax calculation contains an inherent
degree of uncertainty surrounding the realizability of the
tax positions included in the calculation. The term ‘‘tax
position’’ refers to a position in a previously ﬁled tax
return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax
return that is reﬂected in measuring current or deferred
income tax assets and liabilities. A tax position can result
in a permanent reduction of income taxes payable, a
deferral of income taxes otherwise currently payable to
future years, or a change in the expected realizability of
deferred tax assets. For each tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return, a holding company must
evaluate whether the tax position is more likely than not,
i.e., more than a 50 percent probability, to be sustained
upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In
evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-
than-not recognition threshold, a holding company should
presume that the taxing authority examining the position
will have full knowledge of all relevant information. A
holding company’s assessment of the technical merits of a
tax position should reﬂect consideration of all relevant
authoritative sources, e.g., tax legislation and statutes,
legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law, and
reﬂect the holding company’s determination of the appli-
cability of these sources to the facts and circumstances of
the tax position. A holding company must evaluate each
tax position without consideration of the possibility of an
offset or aggregation with other positions. No tax beneﬁt
can be recorded for a tax position that fails to meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.
Each tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold should be measured to determine
the amount of beneﬁt to recognize in the FR Y-9C. The
tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax
beneﬁt that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority
that has full knowledge of all relevant information. When
measuring the tax beneﬁt, a holding company must
consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes
that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the
facts, circumstances, and information available at the
reporting date. A holding company may not use the
valuation allowance associated with any deferred tax
asset as a substitute for measuring this tax beneﬁt or as an
offset to this amount.
If a holding company’s assessment of the merits of a tax
position subsequently changes, the holding company
should adjust the amount of tax beneﬁt it has recognized
and accrue interest and penalties for any underpayment
of taxes in accordance with the tax laws of each applica-
ble jurisdiction. In this regard, a tax position that previ-
ously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition
threshold should be recognized in the ﬁrst subsequent
quarterly reporting period in which the threshold is met.
A previously recognized tax position that no longer
meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
should be derecognized in the ﬁrst subsequent quarterly
reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met.
Temporary differences result when events are recognized
in one period on the holding company’s books but are
recognized in another period on the holding company’s
tax return. These differences result in amounts of income
or expense being reported in the Report of Income for
Holding Companies in one period but in another period
in the tax returns. There are two types of temporary
differences. Deductible temporary differences reduce tax-
able income in future periods. Taxable temporary differ-
ences result in additional taxable income in future
periods.
For example, a holding company’s provision for credit
losses are expensed for ﬁnancial reporting purposes in
one period. However, for some holding companies, this
amount may not be deducted for tax purposes until the
loans are actually charged off in a subsequent period.
This deductible temporary difference ‘‘originates’’ when
Glossary
GL-54
FR Y-9C
Glossary
September 2020

the provision for credit losses are recorded in the ﬁnan-
cial statements and ‘‘turns around’’ or ‘‘reverses’’ when
the loans are subsequently charged off, creating tax
deductions. Other deductible temporary differences
include writedowns of other real estate owned, the recog-
nition of loan origination fees, and other postemployment
beneﬁts expense.
Depreciation can result in a taxable temporary difference
if a holding company uses the straight-line method to
determine the amount of depreciation expense to be
reported in the Report of Income for Holding Companies
but uses an accelerated method for tax purposes. In the
early years, tax depreciation under the accelerated method
will typically be larger than book depreciation under the
straight-line method. During this period, a taxable tempo-
rary difference originates. Tax depreciation will be less
than book depreciation in the later years when the
temporary difference reverses. Therefore, in any given
year, the depreciation reported in the Report of Income
for Holding Companies will differ from that reported in
the holding company’s tax returns. However, total depre-
ciation taken over the useful life of the asset will be the
same under either method. Other taxable temporary
differences include the undistributed earnings of uncon-
solidated subsidiaries and associated companies and
amounts funded to pension plans that exceed the recorded
expense.
Some events do not have tax consequences and therefore
do not give rise to temporary differences. Certain rev-
enues are exempt from taxation and certain expenses are
not deductible. These events were previously known as
‘‘permanent differences.’’ Examples of such events (for
federal income tax purposes) are interest received on
certain obligations of states and political subdivisions in
the U.S., premiums paid on officers’ life insurance poli-
cies where the holding company is the beneﬁciary, and
70 percent of cash dividends received on the corporate
stock of domestic U.S. corporations owned less than 20
percent.
Deferred tax assets shall be calculated at the report date
by applying the ‘‘applicable tax rate’’ (deﬁned below) to
the holding company’s total deductible temporary differ-
ences and operating loss carryforwards. A deferred tax
asset shall also be recorded for the amount of tax credit
carryforwards available to the holding company. Based
on the estimated realizability of the deferred tax asset, a
valuation allowance should be established to reduce the
recorded deferred tax asset to the amount that is consid-
ered ‘‘more likely than not’’ (i.e., greater than 50 percent
chance) to be realized.
Deferred tax liabilities should be calculated by applying
the ‘‘applicable tax rate’’ to total taxable temporary
differences at the report date.
Net operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards and tax
credit carryforwards–When a holding company’s deduc-
tions exceed its income for income tax purposes, it has
sustained a net operating loss. To the extent permitted
under a taxing authority’s laws and regulations, a net
operating loss that occurs in a year following periods
when the holding company had taxable income may be
carried back to recover income taxes previously paid.
The tax effects of any loss carrybacks that are realizable
through a refund of taxes previously paid is recognized in
the year the loss occurs. In this situation, the applicable
income taxes on the Report of Income for Holding
Companies will reﬂect a credit rather than an expense.
For tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, a holding
company may carry back operating losses for two years
for federal income tax purposes. However, in general, for
tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, a holding
company may no longer carry back operating losses to
recover taxes paid in prior tax years.
Generally, a net operating loss that occurs when loss
carrybacks are not available becomes a net operating loss
carryforward. For tax years beginning before January 1,
2018, a holding company may carry operating losses
forward 20 years for federal income tax purposes. For tax
years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, net operating
losses can be carried forward indeﬁnitely for federal
income tax purposes; however, for net operating losses
arising in such tax years, the amount of loss that can be
carried forward and deducted in a particular year is
limited to 80 percent of a bank’s taxable income in that
year.
Tax credit carryforwards are tax credits which cannot be
used for tax purposes in the current year, but which can
be carried forward to reduce taxes payable in a future
period.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards just as they are for deduct-
ible temporary differences. As a result, a holding com-
pany can recognize the beneﬁt of a net operating loss for
tax purposes or a tax credit carryforward to the extent the
Glossary
FR Y-9C

holding company determines that a valuation allowance
is not considered necessary (i.e., if the realization of the
beneﬁt is more likely than not).
Applicable tax rate–The income tax rate to be used in
determining deferred tax assets and liabilities is the rate
under current tax law that is expected to apply to taxable
income in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or
liabilities are expected to be realized or paid. For tax
years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the federal
corporate tax rate is a ﬂat 21 percent rate. This ﬂat rate
replaced the graduated federal corporate tax rate structure
that applied in prior tax years. If a holding company is
subject to graduated tax rates and the holding company’s
income level is such that graduated tax rates are a
signiﬁcant factor, then the holding company shall use the
average graduated tax rate applicable to the amount of
estimated taxable income in the period in which the
deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or
settled. When the tax law changes, holding companies
shall determine the effect of the change, adjust the
deferred tax asset or liability and include the effect of the
change in Schedule HI, item 9, ‘‘Applicable income taxes
(foreign and domestic).’’
Valuation allowance–A valuation allowance must be
recorded, if needed, to reduce the amount of deferred tax
assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. Changes in the valuation allowance generally
shall be reported in Schedule HI, item 9, ‘‘Applicable
income taxes (foreign and domestic).’’ The following
discussion of the valuation allowance relates to the
allowance, if any, included in the amount of net deferred
tax assets or liabilities to be reported on the balance sheet
(Schedule HC) and in Schedule HC-F, item 2, or Sched-
ule HC-G, item 2. This discussion does not address the
determination of the amount of deferred tax assets, if any,
that is disallowed for regulatory capital purposes and
reported in Schedule HC-R, Part I, items 8, 15.a, and 15.b,
as applicable; and, for advanced approaches holding
companies, item 16.
Holding companies must consider all available evidence,
both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a
valuation allowance. The future realization of deferred
tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of suffi-
cient taxable income of the appropriate character in either
the carryback or carryforward period. Four sources of
taxable income may be available to realize the deferred
tax assets:
(1) Taxable income in carryback years (which can be
offset to recover taxes previously paid),
(2) Reversing taxable temporary differences,
(3) Future taxable income (exclusive of reversing tempo-
rary differences and carryforwards).
(4) Tax-planning strategies.
In general, positive evidence refers to the existence of
one or more of the four sources of taxable income. To the
extent evidence about one or more sources of income is
sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allow-
ance is not necessary (i.e., the holding company can
conclude that the deferred tax asset is more likely than
not to be realized), other sources need not be considered.
However, if a valuation allowance is needed, each source
of income must be evaluated to determine the appropriate
amount of the allowance needed.
Evidence used in determining the valuation allowance
should be subject to objective veriﬁcation. The weight
given to evidence when both positive and negative
evidence exist should be consistent with the extent to
which it can be veriﬁed. Sources (1) and (2) listed above
are more susceptible to objective veriﬁcation and, there-
fore, may provide sufficient evidence regardless of future
events.
The consideration of future taxable income (exclusive of
reversing temporary differences and carryforwards) as a
source for the realization of deferred tax assets will
require subjective estimates and judgments about future
events which may be less objectively veriﬁable.
Examples of negative evidence include:
• Cumulative losses in recent years.
• A history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards
expiring unused.
• Losses expected in early future years by a presently
proﬁtable holding company.
• Unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved,
would adversely affect future proﬁt levels.
• A brief carryback or carryforward that would limit the
ability to realize the deferred tax asset.
Examples of positive evidence include:
• A strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that
created the future deductible amount (tax loss carryfor-
ward or deductible temporary difference) coupled with
Glossary
GL-56
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2015

evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather
than a continuing condition.
• Existing contracts that will generate signiﬁcant income.
• An excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis
of an entity’s net assets in an amount sufficient to
realize the deferred tax asset.
When realization of a holding company’s deferred tax
assets is dependent upon future taxable income, the relia-
bility of a holding company’s projections is very impor-
tant. The holding company’s record in achieving projected
results under an actual operating plan will be a strong
measure of this reliability. Other factors a holding com-
pany should consider in evaluating evidence about its
future proﬁtability include but are not limited to current
and expected economic conditions, concentrations of
credit risk within speciﬁc industries and geographical
areas, historical levels and trends in past due and nonac-
crual assets, historical levels and trends in loan loss
reserves, and the holding company’s interest rate sensitiv-
ity.
When strong negative evidence, such as the existence of
cumulative losses, exists, it is extremely difficult for a
holding company to determine that no valuation allow-
ance is needed. Positive evidence of signiﬁcant quality
and quantity would be required to counteract such nega-
tive evidence.
For purposes of determining the valuation allowance, a
tax-planning strategy is a prudent and feasible action that
would result in realization of deferred tax assets and that
management ordinarily might not take, but would do so to
prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from
expiring unused. For example, a holding company could
accelerate taxable income to utilize carryforwards by
selling or securitizing loan portfolios, selling appreciated
securities, or restructuring nonperforming assets. Actions
that management would take in the normal course of
business are not considered tax-planning strategies.
Signiﬁcant expenses to implement the tax-planning strat-
egy and any signiﬁcant losses that would result from
implementing the strategy shall be considered in deter-
mining any beneﬁt to be realized from the tax-planning
strategy. Also, holding companies should consider all
possible consequences of any tax-planning strategies. For
example, loans pledged as collateral would not be avail-
able for sale.
The determination of whether a valuation allowance is
needed for deferred tax assets should be made for total
deferred tax assets, not for deferred tax assets net of
deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the evaluation should
be made on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Separate
analyses should be performed for amounts related to each
taxing authority (e.g., federal, state, and local).
Deferred tax assets (net of the valuation allowance) and
deferred tax liabilities related to a particular tax jurisdic-
tion (e.g., federal, state, and local) may be offset against
each other for reporting purposes. A resulting debit
balance shall be included in ‘‘Other assets’’ and reported
in Schedule HC-F, item 2. A resulting credit balance shall
be included in ‘‘Other liabilities’’ and reported in Sched-
ule HC-G, item 2. A holding company may report a net
deferred tax debit, or asset, for one tax jurisdiction (e.g.,
federal taxes) and also report a net deferred tax credit, or
liability, for another tax jurisdiction (e.g., state taxes).
Interim period applicable income taxes–When preparing
its year-to-date Report of Income for Holding Companies
as of the end of March, June, and September (‘‘interim
periods’’), a holding company generally should deter-
mine its best estimate of its effective annual tax rate for
the full year, including both current and deferred portions
and considering all tax jurisdictions (e.g., federal, state
and local). To arrive at its estimated effective annual tax
rate, a holding company should divide its estimated total
applicable income taxes (current and deferred) for the
year by its estimated pretax income for the year (exclud-
ing “discontinued operations”) This rate would then be
applied to the year-to-date pretax income to determine
the year- to-date applicable income taxes at the interim
date.
Intraperiod allocation of income taxes–When the
Report of Income for Holding Companies for a period
includes the results of “Discontinued operations” that
are reportable in Schedule HI, item 11, the total amount
of the applicable income taxes taxes for the year to date
shall be allocated in Schedule HI between item 9,
“Applicable income taxes (foreign and domestic),” and
item 11, “Discontinued operations, net of applicable
income taxes.”
The applicable income taxes on operating income (item
9) shall be the amount that the total applicable income
taxes on pretax income, including both current and
deferred taxes (calculated as described above), would
have been for the period had the results of “Discontinued
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-57
Glossary
September 2016

operations” been zero. The difference between item 9,
“Applicable income taxes (foreign and domestic),” and
the total amount of the applicable taxes shall then be
reﬂected in item 11 as applicable income taxes on
discontinued operations.
Tax calculations by tax jurisdiction–Separate calcula-
tions of income taxes, both current and deferred
amounts, are required for each tax jurisdiction. How-
ever, if the tax laws of the state and local jurisdictions
do not signiﬁcantly differ from federal income tax laws,
then the calculation of deferred income tax expense can
be made in the aggregate. The holding company would
calculate both current and deferred tax expense consid-
ering the combination of federal, state and local income
tax rates. The rate used should consider whether
amounts paid in one jurisdiction are deductible in
another jurisdiction. For example, since state and local
taxes are deductible for federal purposes, the aggregate
combined rate would generally be (1) the federal tax
rate plus (2) the state and local tax rates minus (3) the
federal tax effect of the deductibility of the state and
local taxes at the federal tax rate.
Purchase business combinations–In purchase business
combinations (as described in the Glossary entry for
“Business Combinations”), holding companies shall
recognize as a temporary difference the difference
between the tax basis of acquired assets or liabilities
and the amount of the purchase price allocated to the
acquired assets and liabilities (with certain exceptions
speciﬁed in ASC Topic 740). As a result, the acquired
asset or liability shall be recorded gross and a deferred
tax asset or liability shall be recorded for any resulting
temporary difference.
In a purchase business combination, a deferred tax asset
shall generally be recognized at the date of acquisition
for deductible temporary differences and net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards of either company in
the transaction, net of an appropriate valuation allow-
ance. The determination of the valuation allowance
should consider any provisions in the tax law that may
restrict the use of an acquired company’s carryfor-
wards.
Subsequent recognition (i.e., by elimination of the valu-
ation allowance) of the beneﬁt of deductible temporary
differences and net operating loss or tax credit carryfor-
wards not recognized at the acquisition date will
depend on the source of the beneﬁt. If the valuation
allowance relates to deductible temporary differences
and carryforwards of the acquiring company established
before the acquisition, then subsequent recognition is
reported as a reduction of income tax expense. If the
beneﬁt is related to the acquired company’s deductible
temporary differences and carryforwards, then the bene-
ﬁt is subsequently recognized by ﬁrst reducing any
goodwill related to the acquisition, then by reducing all
other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisi-
tion, and ﬁnally, by reducing income tax expense.
Alternative Minimum Tax20–Any taxes a holding com-
pany must pay in accordance with the alternative mini-
mum tax (AMT) shall be included in the holding com-
pany’s current tax expense. Amounts of AMT paid can
be carried forward in certain instances to reduce the
holding company’s regular tax liability in future years.
The holding company may record a deferred tax asset for
the amount of the AMT credit carryforward, which shall
then be evaluated in the same manner as other deferred
tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is
needed.
Other tax effects–A holding company may have transac-
tions or items that are reportable in Schedule HI-A of the
Report of Income for Holding Companies such as
‘‘Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles
and corrections of material accounting errors,’’ and ‘‘For-
eign currency translation adjustments’’ that are included
in ‘‘Other comprehensive income.’’ These transactions or
other items will enter into the determination of taxable
income in some year (not necessarily the current year),
but are not included in the pretax income reﬂected in
Schedule HI of the Report of Income for Holding Com-
panies. They shall be reported in Schedule HI-A net of
related income tax effects. These effects may increase or

Insurance Commissions: Insurance commissions gener-
ally represent remuneration paid by insurance underwrit-
ers to insurance agents and brokers for the sale of
insurance products. Companies also earn fees for gener-
ating insurance sales leads pursued by third-party insur-
ance agents and by providing other services related to
selling and servicing insurance contracts and maintaining
separate accounts.
Insurance Premiums: Insurance premiums are the con-
sideration paid by policyholders to insurance under-
writers in exchange for the provision of deﬁned future
beneﬁts or for the indemniﬁcation against speciﬁed
insured losses. For further information, see ASC Topic
944, Financial Services-Insurance (formerly FASB State-
ment No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
Enterprises, and FASB Statement No. 97, Accounting
and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and
Losses from the Sale of Investments).
Insurance Underwriting: Insurance underwriting is the
process whereby insurance companies assume risks (e.g.
that a death, sickness, casualty or other event) will occur,
for which premiums based upon underwriting standards
are charged.
Intangible Assets: See ‘‘Business combinations.’’
Interest-Bearing Account: See ‘‘Deposits.’’
Interest Capitalization: See ‘‘Capitalization of interest.’’
Internal-Use Computer Software: Guidance on the
accounting and reporting for the costs of internal-use
computer software is set forth in ASC Subtopic 350-40,
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software.
A summary of this accounting guidance follows. For
further information, see ASC Subtopic 350-40. Internal-
use computer software is software that meets both of the
following characteristics: (1) The software is acquired,
internally developed, or modiﬁed solely to meet the
holding company’s internal needs; and (2) During the
software’s development or modiﬁcation, no substantive
plan exists or is being developed to market the software
externally.
ASC
Subtopic
350-40
identiﬁes
three
stages
of
development for internal-use software: the preliminary
project stage, the application development stage, and the
post- implementation/operation stage. The processes that
occur during the preliminary project stage of software
development are the conceptual formulation of alterna-
tives, the evaluation of the alternatives, the determination
of the existence of needed technology, and the ﬁnal
selection of alternatives. The application development
stage involves the design of the chosen path (including
software conﬁguration and software interfaces), coding,
installation of software to hardware, and testing (includ-
ing the parallel processing phase). Generally, training and
application
maintenance
occur
during
the
post-
implementation/operation
stage.
Upgrades
of
and
enhancements to existing internal-use software, i.e.,
modiﬁcation to software that result in additional function-
ality, also go through the three aforementioned stages of
development.
Computer software costs that are incurred in the prelimi-
nary project stage should be expensed as incurred.
Internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-
use software during the application development stage
should be capitalized. Capitalization of these costs should
begin once (a) the preliminary project stage is completed
and (b) management, with the relevant authority, implic-
itly or explicitly authorizes and commits to funding a
computer software project and it is probable that the
project will be completed and the software will be used to
perform the function intended. Capitalization should
cease no later than when a computer software project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use, i.e.,
after all substantial testing is completed. Capitalized
internal-use computer software costs generally should be
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the software.
Only the following application development stage costs
should be capitalized: (1) External direct costs of materi-
als and services consumed in developing or obtaining
internal-use software; (2) Payroll and payroll-related
21. A 39% tax rate applies to taxable income from $100,001 to
$335,000; a 34% tax rate applies to taxable income from $335,001 to
$10,000,000; a tax rate of 35% applies to taxable income from $10,000,001
to $15,000,000; a tax rate of 38% applies to taxable income from
$15,000,001 to $18,333,333; and a 35% tax rate applies to taxable income
over $18,333,333.

costs for employees who are directly associated with and
who devote time to the internal-use computer software
project (to the extent of the time spent directly on the
project); and (3) Interest costs incurred when developing
internal-use software.
Costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access
or conversion of old data by new systems also should be
capitalized. Otherwise, data conversion costs should be
expensed as incurred. General and administrative costs
and overhead costs should not be capitalized as internal-
use software costs. During the post-implementation/
operation stage, internal and external training costs and
maintenance costs should be expensed as incurred.
Impairment of capitalized internal-use computer soft-
ware costs should be recognized and measured in accor-
dance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equip-
ment.
The costs of internally developed computer software to
be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as a separate
product or process should be reported in accordance with
ASC Subtopic 985-20, Software – Costs of Software to
Be Sold, Leased or Marketed. If, after the development of
internal-use software is completed, a holding company
decides to market the software, proceeds received from
the license of the software, net of direct incremental
marketing costs, should be applied against the carrying
amount of the software.
International
Banking
Facility
(IBF):
General
deﬁnition—An International Banking Facility (IBF) is a
set of asset and liability accounts, segregated on the
books and records of the establishing entity, which reﬂect
international transactions. An IBF is established in accor-
dance with the terms of Federal Reserve Regulation D
and after appropriate notiﬁcation to the Federal Reserve.
The establishing entity may be a U.S. depository institu-
tion, a U.S. office of an Edge or Agreement corporation,
or a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank pursuant
to Federal Reserve Regulation D. An IBF is permitted
to hold only certain assets and liabilities. In general,
IBF accounts are limited, as speciﬁed in the paragraphs
below, to non-U.S. residents of foreign countries, resi-
dents of Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions,
other IBFs, and U.S. and non-U.S. offices of the establish-
ing entity.
Permissible IBF assets include extensions of credit to the
following:
(1) non-U.S. residents (including foreign branches of
other U.S. banks);
(2) other IBFs; and
(3) U.S. and non-U.S. offices of the establishing entity.
Credit may be extended to non-U.S. nonbank residents
only if the funds are used in their operations outside the
United States. IBFs may extend credit in the form of a
loan, deposit, placement, advance, security, or other
similar asset.
Permissible IBF liabilities include (as speciﬁed in Fed-
eral Reserve Regulation D) liabilities to non-U.S. non-
bank residents only if such liabilities have a minimum
maturity or notice period of at least two business days.
IBF liabilities also may include overnight liabilities to:
(1) non-U.S. offices of other depository institutions and
of Edge or Agreement corporations;
(2) non-U.S. offices of foreign banks;
(3) Foreign governments and official institutions;
(4) other IBFs; and
(5) the establishing entity.
IBF liabilities may be issued in the form of deposits,
borrowings, placements, and other similar instruments.
However, IBFs are prohibited from issuing negotiable
certiﬁcates of deposit, bankers acceptances, or other
negotiable or bearer instruments.
Treatment of the IBFs of bank subsidiaries of the holding
company on the Consolidated Financial Statements for
Holding Companies (FR Y-9C)—IBFs established by a
subsidiary of the holding company (e.g., by a bank
subsidiary or by its Edge or Agreement subsidiaries) are
to be consolidated in the FR Y-9C. In the consolidated
balance sheet (Schedule HC) and income statement
(Schedule HI), transactions between the IBFs of the bank
subsidiaries of the reporting holding company and
between these IBFs and other offices of the holding
company are to be eliminated. For purposes of these
reports, the IBFs of the holding companies’ banking
subsidiaries are to be treated as foreign offices where, in
the schedules, a distinction is made between foreign and
domestic offices of the reporting holding company.
Assets of the IBFs of the banking subsidiaries of the
reporting holding company should be reported in the
asset categories of the report by type of instrument and
Glossary
GL-60
FR Y-9C

customer, as appropriate. For example, IBFs are to report
their holdings of securities in Schedule HC, item 2, and
in the appropriate items of Schedule HC-B; their hold-
ings of loans that the IBF has the intent and ability to
hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff
(including loans of immediately available funds that have
an original maturity of one business day or roll over
under a continuing contract that are not securities resale
agreements) in Schedule HC, item 4(b), and in the
appropriate items of Schedule HC-C; and securities
purchased under agreements to resell in Schedule HC,
item 3(b).
For purposes of these reports, all liabilities of the IBFs of
the banking subsidiaries of the reporting holding com-
pany to outside parties are classiﬁed under four headings:
(1) Securities sold under agreements to repurchase,
which are to be reported in Schedule HC, item 14(b);
(2) Borrowings of immediately available funds that have
an original maturity of one business day or roll over
under a continuing contract that are not securities
repurchase agreements, which are to be reported in
Schedule HC-M, item 14;
(3) Accrued liabilities, which are to be reported in
Schedule HC, item 20; and
(4) All other liabilities, including deposits, placements,
and borrowings, which are to be treated as deposit
liabilities in foreign offices and reported in Schedule
HC, item 13(b).
Treatment of transactions with IBFs of other depository
institutions—Transactions between the offices of the
reporting holding company and IBFs outside the scope of
the FR Y-9C are to be reported as transactions with
depository institutions in the U.S., as appropriate. (Note,
however, that only foreign offices of the holding com-
pany and IBFs of its banking subsidiaries are permitted to
have transactions with other IBFs.)
Investments in Common Stock of Unconsolidated
Subsidiaries: See the instruction to Schedule HC, item 8,
‘‘Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and associ-
ated companies.’’
Joint Venture: See ‘‘Subsidiaries.’’
Lease Accounting: A lease is an agreement that transfers
the right to use land, buildings, or equipment for a
speciﬁed period of time. This ﬁnancing device is essen-
tially an extension of credit evidenced by an obligation
between a lessee and a lessor.
Since the creation of the ASC by the FASB, standards for
lease accounting have been set forth in ASC Topic 840,
Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02, “Leases,” which added ASC Topic 842,
Leases. The FASB has since issued various codiﬁcation
improvements for leases and these are referred to collec-
tively as the “Standard” or ASC Topic 842. ASC
Topic 842 does not fundamentally change the lessor
accounting that was set forth in ASC Topic 840; how-
ever, ASC Topic 842 aligns terminology between lessee
and lessor accounting and brings key aspects of lessor
accounting into alignment with the revenue recognition
guidance in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. As a result, the classiﬁcation difference
between direct ﬁnancing leases and sales-type leases for
lessors that was in place in ASC Topic 840 has moved
from a risk-and-rewards principle to a transfer-of-control
principle. There is no longer a distinction in the treatment
of real estate and non-real estate leases by lessors in ASC
Topic 842.
The most signiﬁcant change that ASC Topic 842 makes
is to lessee accounting. ASC Topic 842 requires institu-
tions that lease premises and other ﬁxed assets as lessees
to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease
liability on its balance sheet for most operating leases.
Lease Term - The Standard deﬁnes lease term as the
noncancellable period for which a lessee has the right to
use an underlying asset, together with all of the follow-
ing:
(1) Periods covered by an option to extend the lease if
the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that
option;
(2) Periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if
the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that
option; and
(3) Periods covered by an option to extend (or not to
terminate) the lease in which exercise of the option is
controlled by the lessor.
Reasonable certainty is based on an assessment of factors
at the commencement date of the lease that would create
an economic incentive for the lessee either to exercise or
not exercise an option to extend, terminate, or purchase.
The commencement date of the lease is the date on which
the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use by
Glossary
FR Y-9C

the lessee. Examples of factors that could create eco-
nomic incentives that should be considered include (1) a
lease renewal option priced below market rates and
(2) signiﬁcant leasehold improvements that would be
impaired, business interruption costs, and relocation costs
if the lease term were not extended. For additional
information on the lease term, reasonable certainty, and
commencement date, refer to ASC Topic 842.
Accounting and Reporting by an institution as Les-
see - ASC Topic 842 distinguishes between an operating
lease and a ﬁnance lease. The Standard requires all
lessees to report an ROU asset and a lease liability on the
balance sheet for most operating and ﬁnance leases. The
ROU asset reﬂects the lessee’s control over the leased
item’s economic beneﬁts during the lease term.
While most leases will be reported on a lessee’s balance
sheet, the Standard permits a lessee to make an account-
ing policy election to exempt leases from balance sheet
recognition as long as the lease, as of its commencement
date, has a lease term, as deﬁned above, of 12 months or
less and does not include an option to purchase the
underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to
exercise. This accounting policy election for short-term
leases must be made by class of underlying asset.
In the FR Y-9C report, ROU assets for operating leases
and ﬁnance leases should be reported in Schedule HC,
item 6, “Premises and ﬁxed assets.” Lease liabilities for
ﬁnance leases should be reported in Schedule HC-M,
items 14.c, “Other borrowings,” and 23.b, “Amount of
′Other borrowings’ that are secured.” Lease liabilities for
operating leases should be reported in Schedule HC-G,
item 4, “All other liabilities.”
In the FR Y-9C report, the interest expense on lease
liabilities for ﬁnance leases (measured using the effective
interest method) should be reported in Schedule HI,
item 2.c, “Interest on trading liabilities and other bor-
rowed money.” The amortization expense (typically
straight-line) on the ROU asset for a ﬁnance lease should
be reported in Schedule HI, item 7.b, “Expenses of
premises and ﬁxed assets.” The ROU asset for a ﬁnance
lease generally should be amortized on a straight-line
basis from the commencement date of the lease to the
earlier of the end of the useful life of the ROU asset or the
end of the lease term.
In the FR Y-9C report, operating lease expenses are to be
reported in Schedule HI, item 7.b, “Expenses of premises
and ﬁxed assets,” as a single lease cost calculated so that
this cost (i.e., the interest on the lease liability and the
amortization of the ROU asset) is allocated over the lease
term, generally on a straight-line basis.
Lease Classiﬁcation—Lessee - A lessee classiﬁes a
lease as a ﬁnance lease22 when the terms of the lease
effectively transfer control of the underlying asset and the
substance of the transaction is reﬂective of a sale. This
occurs when any of the following ﬁve criteria are met:
(1) The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset
to the lessee by the end of the lease term.
(2) The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the
underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain
to exercise.
(3) The lease term is for the major part of the remaining
economic life of the underlying asset. However, if the
commencement date of the lease falls at or near the
end of the economic life of the underlying asset, this
criterion shall not be used for the purpose of classify-
ing the lease.
(4) The present value of the sum of the lease payments,
as deﬁned in ASC Topic 842, and any residual value
guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reﬂected
in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially
all of the fair value of the underlying asset.
(5) The underlying asset is such a specialized nature that
it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor
at the end of the lease term.
If none of the ﬁnance lease criteria are met and the lease
is not a short-term lease for which the holding company
has elected the short-term lease policy election, the lease
is classiﬁed as an operating lease.
Lease Measurement - Lessee - The determination of
whether a contract is or contains a lease is performed at
its inception (the date the contract is agreed upon) and is
reassessed only if the terms and conditions of the contract
are changed. The classiﬁcation and measurement of a
lease are determined at the commencement date of the
lease.
At the commencement date, the ROU asset consists of:
22. ASC Topic 842 requires that land be considered a separate lease
component in a contract involving land and other assets, unless the effect
of separately accounting for the land portion of the contract is insigniﬁcant.
Glossary

(1) The amount of the initial measurement of the lease
liability;
(2) Any lease payments made to the lessor at or before
the commencement date, minus any lease incentives
received; and
(3) Any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee.
At the commencement date, the lease liability equals the
present value of the lease payments not yet paid, dis-
counted using the discount rate for the lease.23 The lease
payments consist of:
(1) Fixed lease payments, less any lease incentives pay-
able to the lessee;
(2) Variable lease payments tied to an index or a rate,
measured using the index or rate at lease commence-
ment;
(3) The exercise price of an option to purchase the leased
asset, if that option is reasonably certain of being
exercised;
(4) Payments for penalties to terminate the lease, if it is
reasonably certain that such penalties will be incurred;
(5) Fees owed by the lessee to the owners of a special-
purposes entity for structuring the transaction; and
(6) Amounts probable of being owed by the lessee under
residual value guarantees.
Regulatory Capital Treatment of Leases for a Lessee –
To the extent an ROU asset arises due to a lessee’s lease
of a tangible asset (e.g., building or equipment), the
lessee institution should treat the ROU asset as a tangible
asset not subject to deduction from regulatory capital.
ROU assets must be risk weighted at 100 percent in
accordance with the agencies’ regulatory capital rules
and included in the lessee institution’s calculation of total
risk-weighted assets, except for an institution subject to
the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework.
In addition, the lessee institution should include its ROU
assets in its total assets for leverage ratio calculation
purposes.
Accounting and Reporting by an Institution as Les-
sor – ASC Topic 842 did not signiﬁcantly change the
lessor’s accounting that was in place under ASC
Topic 840. ASC Topic 842 clariﬁes that, for sales-type
and direct ﬁnancing leases, the lessor assesses its net
investment in the lease (described below under “Lease
Measurement – Lessor”) for expected credit losses under
Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses –
Measured at Amortized Cost. Operating lease assets
remain on the lessor’s balance sheet and shall be assessed
for impairment under ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant,
and Equipment.
In the FR Y-9C report, the lessor should report the net
investment in the lease in Schedule HC-C, Part I, item 10,
“Lease ﬁnancing receivables.” In the FR Y-9C Report of
Income, the income on the lease should be reported in
Schedule HI, item 1.b, “Income from lease ﬁnancing
receivables.”
For operating leases, the lessor shall depreciate the leased
property in accordance with the institution’s normal
policy and reports the property (net of depreciation) in
Schedule HC-F, item 6, “All other assets.” Rental income
is reported in Schedule HI, item 5.l, “Other noninterest
income,” over the term of an operating lease.
Lease Classiﬁcation – Lessor – Accounting by an
institution as a lessor results in classifying a lease as a
sales-type, direct ﬁnancing, or operating lease based on
an assessment of the criteria described in the following
paragraphs at the commencement date of the lease.
A lessor classiﬁes a lease as a sales-type lease if any one
of the ﬁve criteria described above under “Lease Classi-
ﬁcation – Lessee” is met, subject to the clariﬁcation of
criterion (4) described below. Otherwise, the lessor is
required to assess whether the lease is a direct ﬁnancing
lease or an operating lease.
A lease that does not meet any of the ﬁve criteria for a
sales-type lease, but meets the following two criteria,
shall be classiﬁed as a direct ﬁnancing lease.
(1) The present value of the sum of the lease payments
and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that
is not already reﬂected in the lease payments and/or
any other third party unrelated to the lessor equals or
exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the
underlying asset; and
23. As deﬁned in ASC Topic 842, the discount rate for the lease for a
lessee is the rate implicit in the lease (see the footnote in the “Lease
Measurement – Lessor – Sales-Type and Direct Financing Leases” section
below) unless that rate cannot be readily determined, in which case the
lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The lessee’s
incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the lessee would have
to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount
equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-63
Glossary

(2) It is probable that the lessor will collect the lease
payments plus any amount necessary to satisfy a
residual value guarantee.
If a lease does not meet the criteria for a sales-type or a
direct ﬁnancing lease, the lessor institution shall account
for the lease as an operating lease.
For purposes of assessing criterion (4) above under
“Lease Classiﬁcation – Lessee” for a sales-type lease and
criterion (1) above for a direct ﬁnancing lease, the
codiﬁcation improvements in ASU 2019-01 clariﬁed
that, for a lessor that is not a manufacturer or a dealer
(e.g., a ﬁnancial institution), the fair value of the under-
lying asset at lease commencement is ordinarily its cost,
reﬂecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply,
instead of fair value as deﬁned in ASC Topic 820, Fair
Value Measurement. However, if signiﬁcant time lapses
between the acquisition of the underlying asset and lease
commencement, a lessor institution is required to apply
the deﬁnition of fair value in ASC Topic 820.
Lease Measurement – Lessor – Sales-Type and Direct
Financing Leases – At the commencement date of the
lease, the net investment in a sales-type or a direct
ﬁnancing lease is measured at the present value of the
following amounts, discounted using the rate implicit in
the lease:
(1) The lease payments not yet received by the lessor;
(2) The amount the lessor expects to derive from the
underlying asset following the end of the lease term
that is guaranteed by the lessee or any other third
party unrelated to the lessor; and
(3) The amount the lessor expects to derive from the
underlying asset following the end of the lease term
that is not guaranteed by the lessee or any other third
party unrelated to the lessor (i.e., the unguaranteed
residual asset).
In a direct ﬁnancing lease, selling proﬁt, if any, and initial
direct costs are deferred at the commencement date and
included in the net investment in the lease, but any selling
loss arising from the lease must be recognized. When no
selling proﬁt or loss is recognized in a sales-type lease,
initial direct costs are deferred at the commencement date
and recognized over the lease term as part of the net
investment in the lease.
In addition, at the lease commencement date, the lessor
should derecognize the carrying amount of the under-
lying asset (if previously recognized) unless the lease is a
sales-type lease and collectibility of the lease payments is
not probable as discussed below.
Collectibility – Lessor – Sales-Type and Direct Financ-
ing Leases – In recording either a sales-type lease or a
direct ﬁnancing lease, the collectibility of amounts due
under the lease, including any amount necessary to
satisfy a residual value guarantee, must be probable at the
lease commencement date. If collectibility is not prob-
able, a lease that would otherwise be classiﬁed as a direct
ﬁnancing lease should be accounted for as an operating
lease. For a sales-type lease, if collectibility of amounts
due under the lease is not probable at the lease com-
mencement date, the institution, as lessor, should neither
derecognize the underlying asset nor recognize the net
investment in the lease. Instead, the institution, as lessor,
should recognize lease payments received as a liability
until the earliest of the following:
(1) The collectibility of amounts due under the lease
becomes probable; or
(2) The contract has been terminated and the lease
payments received are nonrefundable; or
(3) The institution, as lessor, has repossessed the leased
asset, it has no further obligation under the lease to
the lessee, and the lease payments received are
nonrefundable.
In a sales-type lease, any selling proﬁt or loss arising
from the lease is recognized in full and initial direct costs
generally are expensed by the lessor at the commence-
ment date unless there is no selling proﬁt or loss to be
recognized or collectibility of amounts due under the
lease is not probable.
Operating Lease - Lessor - In an operating lease, the
leased asset remains on the lessor’s balance sheet and
continues to be depreciated over its estimated useful life.
The lessor defers initial direct costs at the commence-
ment date of the lease. The lease payments and initial
direct costs generally are recognized in income and
expense, respectively, over the lease term on a straight-
line basis, or on another systematic and rational basis if it
is more representative of the pattern in which beneﬁt is
expected to be derived from (i.e., income is earned from)
the use of the underlying asset. Other methods of income
recognition may be used if the results are not materially
different. The lessor is required to use the guidance in
ASC Topic 842 to assess the probability of collection of
Glossary
GL-64
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2015

the lease payments from a lessee at, as well as after, the
lease commencement date. A lessor may elect to supple-
ment the guidance in ASC Topic 842 with the portfolio
allowance approach in ASC Subtopic 450-20, Contingen-
cies – Loss Contingencies.
Leveraged Leases – Leveraged leases no longer exist
under ASC Topic 842. The Standard grandfathers the
ASC Topic 840 accounting treatment for leveraged leases
existing on the date of adoption of ASC Topic 842.
However, lessors are required to follow the criteria in
ASC Topic 842 when classifying and accounting for any
grandfathered leveraged leases modiﬁed after the date of
adoption of the Standard.
Sale and Leaseback Transactions – In a sale and
leaseback transaction, the seller-lessee sells an asset it
owns to the buyer-lessor and leases back all or a portion
of the same asset for all or a portion of the asset’s
remaining economic life. For the transfer of an asset in a
sale and leaseback transaction to qualify for sale treat-
ment, ASC Topic 842 requires certain criteria within
ASC Topic 606 to be met. In general, under ASC
Topic 606, an institution is required to determine whether
a contract exists (within the meaning of ASC Topic 606)
and whether the seller-lessee has satisﬁed its perfor-
mance obligations by transferring control of the asset to
the buyer-lessor.
These criteria also require, among other things, that a
contract with a related party have commercial substance
(that is, the risk, timing, or amount of the seller-lessee’s
future cash ﬂows is expected to change as a result of the
contract). Related party contracts that lack commercial
substance will not qualify for sale treatment in sale and
leaseback transactions.
An option for the seller-lessee to repurchase the asset
would preclude accounting for the transfer of the asset as
a sale unless both of the following criteria are met:
(1) The exercise price of the option is the fair value of
the asset at the time the option is exercised; and
(2) There are alternative assets, substantially the same as
the transferred asset, readily available in the market-
place.
However, if the contract for the asset transfer contains a
repurchase option and the leased asset is real estate,
control of the asset has not been transferred to the
buyer-lessor and therefore the transaction is not expected
to meet the criteria necessary under ASC Topic 606 to
recognize a sale. Additionally, if the leaseback is a
ﬁnance lease for the seller-lessee, control has not been
transferred, and thus there is no sale.
The classiﬁcation of a lease can also impact whether a
sale has occurred for accounting purposes. In the event a
leaseback is classiﬁed as a ﬁnance lease by the seller-
lessee, or a sales-type lease by the buyer-lessor, then a
sale has not occurred since a ﬁnance lease is essentially
the purchase of an asset and a sales-type lease is essen-
tially a sale of an asset. As such, the transaction would be
considered a failed sale and leaseback transaction.
If the transaction qualiﬁes as a sale in accordance with
ASC Topic 606 and the transaction would not be consid-
ered a failed sale and leaseback, any gain or loss on the
sale is recognized immediately. If the transaction would
not meet the criteria for a sale under ASC Topic 606, or
when the leaseback would not be classiﬁed as an operat-
ing lease by the seller-lessee (i.e., would be a failed sale
and leaseback), the transaction would be accounted for as
a ﬁnancing arrangement by the seller-lessee and a lend-
ing transaction by the buyer-lessor. The seller-lessee
would not derecognize the transferred asset and would
continue to depreciate the asset as if it were the legal
owner. Any sales proceeds received by the seller-lessee
would be reported as a liability.
Letter of Credit: A letter of credit is a document issued
by a holding company or its consolidated subsidiaries
(generally a banking subsidiary) on behalf of its customer
(the account party) authorizing a third party (the beneﬁ-
ciary), or in special cases the account party, to draw
drafts on the holding company or its consolidated subsid-
iary up to a stipulated amount and with speciﬁed terms
and conditions. The letter of credit is a conditional
commitment (except when prepaid by the account party)
on the part of the consolidated holding company to
provide payment on drafts drawn in accordance with the
terms of the document.
As a matter of sound practice, letters of credit should:
(1) be conspicuously labeled as a letter of credit;
(2) contain a speciﬁed expiration date or be for a deﬁnite
term;
(3) be limited in amount;
(4) call upon the issuing holding company or its issuing
consolidated subsidiaries to pay only upon the pre-
sentation of a draft or other documents as speciﬁed in

the letter of credit and not require the issuing holding
company or consolidated subsidiaries to make deter-
minations of fact or law at issue between the account
party and the beneﬁciary; and
(5) be issued only subject to an agreement between the
account party and the issuing holding company or its
consolidated subsidiaries which establishes the
unqualiﬁed obligation of the account party to reim-
burse the issuing holding company or its consoli-
dated subsidiaries for all payments made under the
letter of credit.
There are four basic types of letters of credit:
(1) commercial letters of credit,
(2) letters of credit sold for cash,
(3) travelers’ letters of credit, and
(4) standby letters of credit, each of which is discussed
separately below.
A commercial letter of credit is issued speciﬁcally to
facilitate trade or commerce. Under the terms of a
commercial letter of credit, as a general rule, drafts will
be drawn when the underlying transaction is consum-
mated as intended.
A letter of credit sold for cash is a letter of credit for which
the holding company or a consolidated subsidiary has
received funds from the account party at the time of
issuance. This type of letter of credit is not to be reported
as an outstanding letter of credit but as a demand deposit.
These letters are considered to have been sold for cash
even though the consolidated holding company may have
advanced funds to the account party for the purchase of
such letters of credit on a secured or unsecured basis.
A travelers’ letter of credit is issued to facilitate travel.
This letter of credit is addressed by the holding company
or its consolidated subsidiaries to its correspondents au-
thorizing the correspondents to honor drafts drawn by the
person named in the letter of credit in accordance with
speciﬁed terms. These letters are generally sold for cash.
A standby letter of credit is a letter of credit or similar
arrangement that:
(1) represents an obligation on the part of the issuing
holding company or a consolidated subsidiary to a
designated third party (the beneﬁciary) contingent
upon the failure of the issuing consolidated holding
company’s customer (the account party) to perform
under the terms of the underlying contract with the
beneﬁciary, or
(2) obligates the holding company or a consolidated
subsidiary to guarantee or stand as surety for the
beneﬁt of a third party to the extent permitted by law
or regulation.
The underlying contract may entail either ﬁnancial or
nonﬁnancial undertakings of the account party with the
beneﬁciary. The underlying contract may involve such
things as the customer’s payment of commercial paper,
delivery of merchandise, completion of a construction
contract, release of maritime liens, or repayment of the
account party’s obligations to the beneﬁciary. Under the
terms of a standby letter, as a general rule, drafts will be
drawn only when the underlying event fails to occur as
intended.
Limited-Life Preferred Stock: See “Preferred Stock.”
Loan: For purposes of this report, a loan is generally an
extension of credit resulting from direct negotiations
between a lender and a borrower. The reporting holding
company or its consolidated subsidiaries may originate a
loan by directly negotiating with a borrower or it may
purchase a loan or a portion of a loan originated by
another lender that directly negotiated with a borrower.
The reporting holding company or its subsidiaries may
also sell a loan or a portion of a loan, regardless of the
method by which it acquired the loan.
Loans may take the form of promissory notes, acknowl-
edgments of advance, due bills, invoices, overdrafts,
acceptances, and similar written or oral obligations.
Among the extensions of credit reportable as loans in
Schedule HC-C, which covers both loans held for sale
and loans that the reporting holding company has the
intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or
until maturity or payoff, are:
(1) acceptances of banks that are not consolidated sub-
sidiaries for the reporting holding company’s FR
Y-9C;
(2) acceptances executed by or for the account of a
subsidiary bank of the reporting holding company
and subsequently acquired by the consolidated hold-
ing company through purchase or discount;
Glossary

(3) customers’ liability to a bank subsidiary of the
reporting holding company on drafts paid under
letters of credit for which the bank subsidiary of the
reporting holding company has not been reimbursed;
(4) ‘‘advances’’ and commodity or bill-of-lading drafts
payable upon arrival of goods against which drawn,
for which a bank subsidiary of the reporting holding
company has given deposit credit to customers;
(5) paper pledged by the holding company or by its con-
solidated subsidiaries whether for collateral to secure
bills payable (e.g., margin collateral to secure bills
rediscounted) or for any other purpose;
(6) sales of ‘‘term federal funds’’ (i.e., sales of immedi-
ately available funds with a maturity of more than
one business day), other than those involving secu-
rity resale agreements;
(7) factored accounts receivable;
(8) loans arising out of the purchase of assets (other than
securities) under resale agreements with a maturity of
more than one business day if the agreement requires
the holding company to resell the identical asset
purchased; or
(9) participations (acquired or held) in a single loan or
in a pool of loans or receivables (see discussion in the
Glossary entry for “Transfers of Financial Assets”).
Loan acceptances and commercial paper, held in a trad-
ing account are to be reported in Schedule HC, item 5,
“Trading assets.”
See also “Loan Secured by Real Estate,” “Overdraft,”
and “Sale of Assets.”
Loan Fees: The accounting standards for nonrefundable
fees and costs associated with lending, committing to
lend, and purchasing a loan or group of loans are set forth
in ASC Subtopic 310-20, Receivables – Nonrefundable
Fees and Other Costs, a summary of which follows. The
statement applies to all types of loans as well as to debt
securities (but not to loans or debt securities carried at
fair value if the changes in fair value are included in
earnings) and to all types of lenders. For further informa-
tion, see ASC Subtopic 310-20.
A holding company may acquire a loan by originating the
loan (lending) or by acquiring a loan from a party other
than the borrower (purchasing). Lending, committing to
lend, reﬁnancing or restructuring loans, arranging standby
letters of credit, syndicating loans, and leasing activities
are all considered ‘‘lending activities.’’ Nonrefundable
loan fees paid by the borrower to the lender may have
many different names, such as origination fees, points,
placement fees, commitment fees, application fees, man-
agement fees, restructuring fees, and syndication fees,
but in this Glossary entry, they are referred to as loan
origination fees, commitment fees, or syndication fees.
ASC Subtopic 310-20 applies to both a lender and a
purchaser, and should be applied to individual loan
contracts. Aggregation of similar loans for purposes of
recognizing net fees or costs and purchase premiums or
discounts is permitted under certain circumstances speci-
ﬁed in ASC Subtopic 310-20 or if the result does not
differ materially from the amount that would have been
recognized on an individual loan-by-loan basis. In gen-
eral, the ASC Subtopic 310-20 speciﬁes that:
(1) Loan origination fees should be deferred and recog-
nized over the life of the related loan as an adjust-
ment of yield (interest income). Once a holding
company adopts ASC Subtopic 310-20, recognizing
a portion of loan fees as revenue to offset all or part
of origination costs in the reporting period in which a
loan is originated is no longer acceptable.
(2) Certain direct loan origination costs speciﬁed in the
ASC Subtopic 310-20 should be deferred and recog-
nized over the life of the related loan as a reduction
of the loan’s yield. Loan origination fees and related
direct loan origination costs for a given loan should
be offset and only the net amount deferred and
amortized.
(3) Direct loan origination costs should be offset against
related commitment fees and the net amounts deferred
except for: (a) commitment fees (net of costs) where
the likelihood of exercise of the commitment is
remote, which generally should be recognized as
service fee income on a straight line basis over the
loan commitment period, and (b) retrospectively
determined fees, which are recognized as service fee
income on the date as of which the amount of the fee
is determined. All other commitment fees (net of
costs) shall be deferred over the entire commitment
period and recognized as an adjustment of yield over
the related loan’s life or, if the commitment expires
unexercised, recognized in income upon expiration
of the commitment.

(4) Loan syndication fees should be recognized by the
institution managing a loan syndication (the syndica-
tor) when the syndication is complete unless a por-
tion of the syndication loan is retained. If the yield on
the portion of the loan retained by the syndicator is
less than the average yield to the other syndication
participants after considering the fees passed through
by the syndicator, the syndicator should defer a
portion of the syndication fee to produce a yield on
the portion of the loan retained that is not less than
the average yield on the loans held by the other
syndication participants.
(5) Loan fees, certain direct loan origination costs, and
purchase premiums and discounts on loans shall be
recognized as an adjustment of yield generally by the
interest method based on the contractual term of the
loan. However, if the holding company holds a large
number of similar loans for which prepayments are
probable and the timing and amount of prepayments
can be reasonably estimated, the holding company
may consider estimates of future principal prepay-
ments in the calculation of the constant effective
yield necessary to apply the interest method. Once a
holding company adopts ASC Subtopic 310-20, the
practice of recognizing fees over the estimated aver-
age life of a group of loans is no longer acceptable.
(6) A reﬁnanced or restructured loan, including loan
modiﬁcations to borrowers experiencing ﬁnancial
difficulty, should be accounted for as a new loan if
following exists: 1) the terms of the new loan are at
least as favorable to the lender as the terms for
comparable loans to other customers with similar
collection risks who are not reﬁnancing or restructur-
ing a loan and 2) the change in cash ﬂows is more
than minor. Any unamortized net fees or costs and
any prepayment penalties from the original loan
should be recognized in interest income when the
new loan is granted. If the reﬁnancing or restructur-
ing does not meet these conditions or if only minor
modiﬁcations are made to the original loan contract,
the unamortized net fees or costs from the original
loan and any prepayment penalties should be carried
forward as a part of the amortized cost basis of the
new loan. The net investment in, or the amortized
cost basis of, the new loan, as applicable, should
consist of the remaining net investment in the origi-
nal loan, any additional amounts loaned, any fees
received, and direct loan origination costs associated
with the transaction. See also “Loan Modiﬁcations to
Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty.”
(7) Deferred net fees or costs shall not be amortized
during periods in which interest income on a loan is
not being recognized because of concerns about
realization of loan principal or interest.
Direct loan origination costs of a completed loan are
deﬁned to include only (a) incremental direct costs of
loan origination incurred in transactions with indepen-
dent third parties for that particular loan and (b) certain
costs directly related to speciﬁed activities performed by
the lender for that particular loan.24 Incremental direct
costs are costs to originate a loan that (a) result directly
from and are essential to the lending transaction and (b)
would not have been incurred by the lender had that
lending transaction not occurred. The speciﬁed activities
performed by the lender are evaluating the prospective
borrower’s ﬁnancial condition; evaluating and recording
guarantees, collateral, and other security arrangements;
negotiating loan terms; preparing and processing loan
documents; and closing the transaction. The costs directly
related to those activities include only that portion of the
employees’ total compensation and payroll-related fringe
beneﬁts directly related to time spent performing those
activities for that particular loan and other costs related to
those activities that would not have been incurred but for
that particular loan.
All other lending-related costs, whether or not incremen-
tal, should be charged to expense as incurred, including
costs related to activities performed by the lender for
advertising, identifying potential borrowers, soliciting
potential borrowers, servicing existing loans, and other
ancillary activities related to establishing and monitoring
credit policies, supervision, and administration. Employ-
ees’ compensation and fringe beneﬁts related to these
activities, unsuccessful loan origination efforts, and idle
time should be charged to expense as incurred. Adminis-
trative costs, rent, depreciation, and all other occupancy
and equipment costs are considered indirect costs and
should be charged to expense as incurred.
Net unamortized loan fees represent an adjustment of the
loan yield, and shall be reported in the same manner as
24. For purposes of this report, a holding company which deems its
costsfor these lending activities not to be material and which need not
maintain records on a loan-by-loan basis for other purposes may expense
such costs as incurred.

unearned income on loans, i.e., deducted from the related
loan balances (to the extent possible) or deducted from
total loans in ‘‘Any unearned income on loans reﬂected in
items 1-9 above’’ in Schedule HC-C. Net unamortized
direct loan origination costs shall be added to the related
loan balances in Schedule HC-C. Amounts of loan
origination, commitment, and other fees and costs recog-
nized as an adjustment of yield should be reported under
the appropriate subitem of item 1, ‘‘Interest income,’’ in
Schedule HI. Other fees, such as (a) commitment fees
that are recognized during the commitment period or
included in income when the commitment expires (i.e.
fees retrospectively determined and fees for commit-
ments where exercise is remote) and (b) syndication fees
that are not deferred, should be reported as ‘‘Other
noninterest income’’ on Schedule HI.
Loan Modiﬁcations to Borrowers Experiencing Finan-
cial Difficulty:The accounting standards for loan modiﬁ-
cations to borrowers experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty are
set forth in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments –
Credit Losses and ASC Topic 310, Receivables. ASC
Subtopic 310-10 requires modiﬁcations of receivables to
borrowers experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty where the
modiﬁcation results in the form of principal forgiveness,
an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insigniﬁcant
payment delay, or a term extension (or a combination
thereof) to be disclosed for ﬁnancial reporting purposes.
These disclosures only include loan modiﬁcations to
borrowers experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty, regardless of
whether the modiﬁcations result in new loans or the
continuation of existing loans. Loan modiﬁcations to
borrowers who are not experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty or
do not meet the deﬁnition above would not be disclosed.
For reporting purposes, loans modiﬁed to borrowers
experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty must be included in the
amounts reported in the appropriate loan category in
Schedule HC-C, Loans and Leases, items 1 through 9.
Additionally, if the loan is in compliance with its modi-
ﬁed terms, these modiﬁcations are reported in the appro-
priate loan category in Schedule HC-C, Memorandum
item 1. For loans that are not in compliance with their
modiﬁed terms, the loans must be included in the
amounts reported in the appropriate loan category in
Schedule HC-N, items 1 through 7, and reported in
Schedule HC-N, Memorandum item 1.
See the Glossary entry for “Nonaccrual Status” for a
discussion of the conditions under which a loan on
nonaccrual that has undergone a modiﬁcation to a bor-
rower experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty (including those
that involve a multiple note structure) may be returned to
accrual status. Other Considerations - A modiﬁcation of a
loan in which an institution receives physical possession
of the borrower’s assets, whether in full or partial satis-
faction of the debt, should be accounted for in accordance
with ASC Subtopic 310-20. In such situations, the loan
should be treated as if assets have been received in
satisfaction of the loan and reported as described in the
Glossary entry for ″Foreclosed Assets.″
In addition, if a modiﬁcation of a loan includes both a
modiﬁcation of terms and the acceptance of property in
partial satisfaction of the loan, the accounting for such a
modiﬁcation is a two-step process. First, the amortized
cost basis of the loan is reduced by the fair value (less
cost to sell, if appropriate) of the property received, and
second, the holding company is expected to measure any
expected credit losses on the remaining recorded balance,
or amortized cost basis, as applicable, of the modiﬁed
loan in accordance with ASC Subtopic 326-20, Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized
Cost, and record any related allowance. If the modiﬁca-
tion of terms meets the deﬁnition of the loan modiﬁcation
to a borrower experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty, then
include the loan in the amounts reported on Schedule
HC-C or Schedule HC-N, as appropriate.
A modiﬁcation may also involve the substitution or
addition of a new debtor for the original borrower. The
treatment of these situations depends upon their sub-
stance. Modiﬁcations in which the substitute or addi-
tional debtor controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with the original borrower, or performs
the custodial function of collecting certain of the original
borrower’s funds, should be accounted for as modiﬁca-
tions of terms. Modiﬁcations in which the substitute or
additional debtor does not have a control or custodial
relationship with the original borrower should be
accounted for as a receipt of a “new” loan in full or
partial satisfaction of the original borrower’s loan. The
″new″ loan should be recorded at its fair value. If the
modiﬁcation of terms meets the deﬁnition of the loan
modiﬁcation to a borrower experiencing ﬁnancial diffi-
culty, then include the loan in the amounts reported on
Schedule HC-C or Schedule HC-N, as appropriate.
Loan Secured by Real Estate: For purposes of this
report, a loan secured by real estate is a loan that, at
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-69
Glossary
December 2024

origination, is secured wholly or substantially by a lien or
liens on real property for which the lien or liens are
central to the extension of the credit–that is, the borrower
would not have been extended credit in the same amount
or on terms as favorable without the lien or liens on real
property. To be considered wholly or substantially secured
by a lien or liens on real property, the estimated value of
the real estate collateral at origination (after deducting
any more senior liens) must be greater than 50 percent of
the principal amount of the loan at origination.25
A loan satisfying the criteria above, except a loan to a
state or political subdivision in the U.S., is to be reported
as a loan secured by real estate in Schedule HC-C, item 1,
and related items in the report, (1) regardless of whether
the loan is secured by a ﬁrst or a junior lien; (2) regard-
less of whether the loan was originated by the reporting
holding company or purchased from others and, if origi-
nated by the reporting holding company, regardless of the
department or subsidiary within the holding company or
subsidiary that made the loan; (3) regardless of how the
loan is categorized in the holding company’s records; (4)
and regardless of the purpose of the ﬁnancing. Only in a
transaction where a lien or liens on real property (with an
estimated collateral value greater than 50 percent of the
loan’s principal amount at origination) have been taken
as collateral solely through an abundance of caution and
where the loan terms as a consequence have not been
made more favorable than they would have been in the
absence of the lien or liens, would the loan not be
considered a loan secured by real estate for purposes of
the FR Y-9C. In addition, when a loan is partially secured
by a lien or liens on real property, but the estimated value
of the real estate collateral at origination (after deducting
any more senior liens held by others) is 50 percent or less
of the principal amount of the loan at origination, the loan
should not be categorized as a loan secured by real estate.
Instead, the loan should be reported in one of the other
loan categories used in these reports based on the purpose
of the loan.
The following are examples of the application of the
preceding guidance:
(1) A subsidiary loans $700,000 to construct and equip a
building that will be used as a dental office. The loan
will be secured by both the real estate and the dental
equipment. At origination, the estimated values of
the building, upon completion, and the equipment are
$400,000 and $350,000, respectively. The loan should
be reported as a loan secured by real estate in
Schedule HC-C, item 1.a.(2), ‘‘Other construction
loans and all land development and other land loans.’’
In contrast, if the estimated values of the building
and equipment at origination were $340,000 and
$410,000, respectively, the loan should not be reported
as a loan secured by real estate. Instead, the loan
should be reported in Schedule HC-C, item 4, “Com-
mercial and industrial loans.”
(2) A subsidiary grants a $25,000 line of credit and a
$125,000 term loan to a commercial borrower for
working capital purposes on the same date. The loans
will be cross-collateralized by equipment with an
estimated value of $40,000 and a third lien on the
borrower’s residence, which has an estimated value
of $140,000 and ﬁrst and second liens with unpaid
balances payable to other lenders totaling $126,000.
The two loans should be considered together to
determine whether they are secured by real estate.
Because the estimated equity in the real estate collat-
eral available to the subsidiary is $14,000, the two
cross-collateralized loans for $150,000 should not be
reported as loans secured by real estate. Instead, the
loans should be reported in Schedule HC-C, item 4,
‘‘Commercial and industrial loans.’’
(3) A subsidiary grants a $50,000 working capital loan
and takes a ﬁrst lien on a vacant commercial building
lot as collateral. The estimated value of the lot is
$30,000. The loan should be reported as a loan
secured by real estate in Schedule HC-C, item 1.a.(2),
‘‘Other construction loans and all land development
and other land loans,’’ unless the lien has been taken
as collateral solely through an abundance of caution
and where the loan terms as a consequence have not
been made more favorable than they would have
been in the absence of the lien.
(4) A subsidiary grants a $10,000 home equity line of
credit secured by a junior lien on a 1-4 family
residential property. The subsidiary also has a loan to
the same borrower that is secured by a ﬁrst lien on
the same 1-4 family residential property and has an
25. Bank holding companies should apply this revised deﬁnition of
“loan secured by real estate” prospectively beginning April 1, 2009. Loans
reported on or before March 31, 2009, as loans secured by real estate need
not be reevaluated and, if apporpriate, recategorized into other loan catego-
ries on Schedule HC-C, Loans and Lease Financing Receivables.

unpaid principal balance of $71,000. There are no
intervening liens and the line of credit will be used
for household, family, and other personal expendi-
tures. The estimated value of the residential property
at the origination of the home equity line of credit is
$75,000. Consistent with the risk-based capital treat-
ment of these loans, the two loans should be consid-
ered together to determine whether the home equity
line of credit should be reported as a loan secured by
real estate. Because the value of the collateral is
greater than 50 percent of the ﬁrst lien balance plus
the amount of the home equity line of credit, loans
extended under the line of credit should be reported
as loans secured by real estate in Schedule HC-C,
item 1.c.(1), ‘‘Revolving, open-end loans secured by
1-4 family residential properties and extended under
lines of credit.’’ In contrast, if a creditor other than
the subsidiary holds the ﬁrst lien on the borrower’s
property, the estimated value of the collateral to the
subsidiary for the home equity line of credit would
have been $4,000 ($75,000 less the $71,000 ﬁrst lien
held by the other creditor), which is 50 percent or less
of the amount of the line of credit at origination. In
this case, the subsidiary should not report loans
extended under the line of credit as loans secured by
real estate in Schedule HC-C, item 1. Rather, the
loans should be reported as “Loans to individuals for
household, family, and other personal expenditures”
in Schedule HC-C, item 6.b, “Other revolving credit
plans.
Loss Contingencies: A loss contingency is an existing
condition, situation, or set of circumstances that involves
uncertainty as to possible loss that will be resolved when
one or more future events occur or fail to occur. An
estimated loss (or expense) from a loss contingency (for
example, pending or threatened litigation) must be accrued
by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has
been impaired or a liability incurred as of the report date
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
A contingency that might result in a gain, for example, the
ﬁling of an insurance claim, shall not be recognized as
income prior to realization.

Contingencies—Loss Contingencies.
Mandatory Convertible Debt: See discussion of manda-
tory convertible securities in instructions for Sched-
ule HC, item 19(a), ‘‘Subordinated notes and debentures.’’
Market (Fair) Value of Securities: The market value of
securities should be determined, to the extent possible, by
timely reference to the best available source of current
market quotations or other data on relative current values.
For example, securities traded on national, regional, or
foreign exchanges or in organized over-the-counter mar-
kets should be valued at the most recently available
quotation in the most active market. Rated securities for
which no organized market exists should be valued on the
basis of a yield curve estimate. Quotations from brokers or
others making markets in securities that are neither widely
nor actively traded are acceptable if prudently used.
Unrated debt securities for which no reliable market price
data are available may be valued at cost adjusted for
amortization of premium or accretion of discount unless
credit problems of the obligor or upward movements in
the level of interest rates warrant a lower estimate of
current value. Securities that are not marketable such as,
Federal Reserve stock or equity securities in closely held
businesses, should be valued at book or par value, as
appropriate.

Nonaccrual Status: General rule—Holding companies
on an accrual basis of reporting shall not accrue interest
or discount on (1) any asset which is maintained on a
cash basis because of deterioration in the ﬁnancial posi-
tion of the borrower, (2) any asset for which payment in
full of interest or principal is not expected, or (3) any
asset upon which principal or interest has been in default
for a period of 90 days or more unless it is both well
secured and in the process of collection.
An asset is “well secured” if it is secured (1) by collateral
in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal
property, including securities, that have a realizable value
sufficient to discharge the debt (including accrued inter-
est) in full, or (2) by the guarantee of a ﬁnancially
responsible party. An asset is “in the process of collec-
tion” if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course
either (1) through legal action, including judgment
enforcement procedures, or, (2) in appropriate circum-
stances, through collection efforts not involving legal

action which are reasonably expected to result in repay-
ment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in
the near future.
For purposes of applying the third test for the nonaccrual
of interest listed above, the date on which an asset
reaches nonaccrual status is determined by its contractual
terms. If the principal or interest on an asset becomes due
and unpaid for 90 days or more on a date that falls
between report dates, the asset should be placed in
nonaccrual status as of the date it becomes 90 days past
due and it should remain in nonaccrual status until it
meets the criteria for restoration to accrual status described
below.
Exceptions to the general rule—In the following situa-
tions, an asset need not be placed in nonaccrual status:
(1) The asset upon which principal or interest is due and
unpaid for 90 days or more is a consumer loan (as
deﬁned for Schedule HC-C, item 6, “Loans to indi-
viduals for household, family, and other personal
expenditures”) or a loan secured by a 1-to-4 family
residential property (as deﬁned for Schedule HC-C,
item 1(c), Loans “Secured by 1-4 family residential
properties”). Nevertheless, such loans should be sub-
ject to other alternative methods of evaluation to
assure that the holding company’s net income is not
materially overstated. However, to the extent that the
holding company has elected to carry such a loan in
nonaccrual status on its books, the loan must be
reported as nonaccrual in Schedule HC-N, column C.
(2) The following criteria are met for a PCD asset,
including a PCD asset that was previously a PCI
asset or part of a pool of PCI loans, that would
otherwise be required to be placed in nonaccrual
status under the general rule:
(a) The holding company reasonably estimates the
timing and amounts of cash ﬂows expected to be
collected, and
(b) The holding company did not acquire the asset
primarily for the rewards of ownership of the
underlying collateral, such as use of collateral in
operations of the institution or improving the
collateral for resale.
When a PCD asset that meets the criteria above is not
placed in nonaccrual status, the asset should be subject to
other alternative methods of evaluation to ensure that the
institution’s net income is not materially overstated. If an
institution is required or has elected to carry a PCD asset
in nonaccrual status, the asset must be reported as a
nonaccrual asset at its amortized cost basis in Sched-
ule HC-N, column C. (For PCD loans for which the
institution has made a policy election to maintain previ-
ously existing pools of PCI loans upon adoption of ASC
Topic 326, the determination of nonaccrual or accrual
status should be made at the pool level, not the individual
asset level.) For further information, see the Glossary
entry for “Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Assets.“
Treatment of previously accrued interest—The reversal
of previously accrued but uncollected interest applicable
to any asset placed in nonaccrual status and the treatment
of subsequent payments as either principal or interest
should be handled in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Acceptable accounting treatment
includes a reversal of all previously accrued but uncol-
lected interest applicable to assets placed in a nonaccrual
status against appropriate income and balance sheet
accounts.
Holding companies should refer to the Glossary entry for
“Accrued Interest Receivable” for information on the
treatment of previously accrued interest.
Treatment of cash payments and criteria for the cash basis
recognition of income—When doubt exists as to the
collectibility of the remaining recorded investment in a
nonaccrual asset or the amortized cost basis of nonaccrual
asset, any payments received must be applied to reduce the
recorded investment, or the amortized cost basis of the
asset, as applicable, to the extent necessary to eliminate
such doubt. Placing an asset in nonaccrual status does not,
in and of itself, require a charge-off, in whole or in part, of
the asset’s recorded investment or the amortized cost
basis, as applicable. However, any identiﬁed losses must
be charged off.
While an asset is in nonaccrual status, some or all of the
cash interest payments received may be treated as interest
income on a cash basis as long as the remaining recorded
investment in, or the amortized cost basis of, the asset, as
applicable, (i.e., after charge-off of identiﬁed losses, if
any) is deemed to be fully collectible.26 A holding
26. An asset subject to the cost recovery method required by ASC
Subtopic 325-40, Investments—Other—Beneﬁcial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets, should follow that method for reporting purposes. In
addition, when a PCD asset has been placed on nonaccrual status, the cost

company’s determination as to the ultimate collectibility
of the asset’s remaining recorded investment, or the
amortized cost basis, as applicable, must be supported by
a current, well documented credit evaluation of the
borrower’s ﬁnancial condition and prospects for repay-
ment, including consideration of the borrower’s histori-
cal repayment performance and other relevant factors.
When recognition of interest income on a cash basis is
appropriate, it should be handled in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. One acceptable
practice involves allocating contractual interest payments
among interest income, reduction of the recorded invest-
ment in, or amortized cost basis of the asset, and recovery
of prior charge-offs. If this method is used, the amount of
income that is recognized would be equal to that which
would have been accrued on the asset’s remaining
recorded investment at the contractual rate. A holding
company may also choose to account for the contractual
interest in its entirety either as income, reduction of the
recorded investment in, or the amortized cost basis of the
asset, as applicable, or recovery of prior charge-offs,
depending on the condition of the loan, consistent with
its accounting policies for other ﬁnancial reporting
purposes.
Restoration to accrual status—As a general rule, a
nonaccrual asset may be restored to accrual status when
(1) none of its principal and interest is due and unpaid,
and the holding company expects repayment of the
remaining contractual principal and interest, or (2) when
it otherwise becomes well secured and in the process of
collection. If any interest payments received while the
asset was in nonaccrual status were applied to reduce the
recorded investment in, or the amortized cost basis of the
asset, as discussed in the preceding section of this entry,
the application of these payments to the asset’s recorded
investment or amortized cost basis, should not be reversed
(and interest income should not be credited) when the
asset is returned to accrual status.
For purposes of meeting the ﬁrst test, the holding com-
pany must have received repayment of the past due
principal and interest unless:
(1) The asset has been formally modiﬁed to a borrower
experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty and qualiﬁes for
accrual status, as discussed below;
(2) The asset is a PCD asset and it meets the two criteria
speciﬁed in the third exception to the general rule
discussed above; or
(3) The borrower has resumed paying the full amount of
the scheduled contractual interest and principal pay-
ments on a loan that is past due and in nonaccrual
status, even though the loan has not been brought
fully current, and the following two criteria are met.
These criteria are, ﬁrst, that all principal and interest
amounts contractually due (including arrearages) are
reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable
period and, second, that there is a sustained period of
repayment performance (generally a minimum of six
months) by the borrower in accordance with the
contractual terms involving payments of cash or cash
equivalents. A loan that meets these two criteria may
be restored to accrual status but must continue to be
disclosed as past due in Schedule HC-N until it has
been brought fully current or until it later must be
placed in nonaccrual status.
A loan or other debt instrument that has been formally
modiﬁed, so as to be reasonably assured of repayment (of
principal and interest) and of performance according to
its modiﬁed terms need not be maintained in nonaccrual
status, provided the restructuring is supported by a
current, well documented credit evaluation of the bor-
rower’s ﬁnancial condition and prospects for repayment
under the revised terms. Otherwise, the modiﬁed asset
must remain in nonaccrual status. The evaluation must
include consideration of the borrower’s sustained histori-
cal repayment performance for a reasonable period prior
to the date on which the loan or other debt instrument is
returned to accrual status. (In returning the asset to
accrual status, sustained historical payment performance
for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring may be
taken into account.) Such a restructuring must improve
the collectibility of the loan or other debt instrument in
accordance with a reasonable repayment schedule and
does not relieve the holding company from the responsi-
bility to promptly charge off all identiﬁed losses.
A modiﬁcation of a loan to a borrower experiencing
ﬁnancial difficulty may involve a multiple note structure
in which, for example, a loan is restructured into two
notes. The ﬁrst or “A” note represents the portion of the
original loan principal amount that is expected to be fully
collected along with contractual interest. The second or
“B” note represents the portion of the original loan that
recovery method should be used, when appropriated.

has been charged off and, because it is not reﬂected as an
asset and is unlikely to be collected, could be viewed as a
contingent receivable. For a modiﬁcation of a collateral-
dependent loan involving a multiple note structure, the
amount of the “A” note should be determined using the
fair value of the collateral. The “A” note may be returned
to accrual status provided the conditions in the preceding
paragraph are met and: (1) there is economic substance to
the restructuring, (2) the portion of the original loan
represented by the “B” note has been charged off before
or at the time of the restructuring, and (3) the “A” note is
reasonably assured of repayment and of performance in
accordance with the modiﬁed terms. In conjunction with
the reporting requirements on Schedule HC-C, and
Schedule HC-N for loan modiﬁcations to borrowers
experiencing ﬁnancial difficulty, the institution should
consider both the “A” and “B” notes in its analysis of
whether the modiﬁcation results in principal forgiveness,
an interest rate reduction, or a deferral of payment(s).
Until the modiﬁed asset is restored to accrual status, if
ever, cash payments received must be treated in accor-
dance with the criteria stated above in the preceding
section of this entry. In addition, after a formal restructur-
ing, if a restructured asset that has been returned to
accrual status later meets the criteria for placement in
nonaccrual status as a result of past due status based on
its modiﬁed terms or for other reasons, the asset must be
placed in nonaccrual status. See also the Glossary entry
for “Loan Modiﬁcations to Borrower Experiencing Finan-
cial Difficulty.”
Treatment of multiple extensions of credit to one
borrower—As a general principle, nonaccrual status for
an asset should be determined based on an assessment of
the individual asset’s collectibility and payment ability
and performance. Thus, when one loan to a borrower is
placed in nonaccrual status, a holding company or its
subsidiaries do not automatically have to place all other
extensions of credit to that borrower in nonaccrual status.
When a depository institution has multiple loans or other
extensions of credit outstanding to a single borrower, and
one loan meets criteria for nonaccrual status, the deposi-
tory institution should evaluate its other extensions of
credit to that borrower to determine whether one or more
of these other assets should also be placed in nonaccrual
status.

Offsetting: Offsetting is the reporting of assets and
liabilities on a net basis in the balance sheet. Holding
companies are permitted to offset assets and liabilities
recognized in the balance sheet when a “right of setoff”
exists. Under ASC Subtopic 210-20, Balance Sheet –
Offsetting, a right of setoff exists when all of the follow-
ing conditions are met:
(1) Each party owes the other determinable amounts.
Thus, only bilateral netting is permitted.
(2) The reporting party has the right to set off the amount
owed with the amount owed by the other party.
(3) The reporting party intends to set off. This condition
does not have to be met for fair value amounts
recognized for conditional or exchange contracts that
have been executed with the same counterparty under
a master netting arrangement.
(4) The right of setoff is enforceable at law. Legal
constraints should be considered to determine whether
the right of setoff is enforceable. Accordingly, the
right of setoff should be upheld in bankruptcy (or
receivership). Offsetting is appropriate only if the
available evidence, both positive and negative,
indicates that there is reasonable assurance that the
right of setoff would be upheld in bankruptcy (or
receivership).
According to ASC Subtopic 210-20, for forward, interest
rate swap, currency swap, option, and other conditional
and exchange contracts, a master netting arrangement
exists if the reporting holding company has multiple
contracts, whether for the same type of conditional or
exchange contract or for different types of contracts, with
a single counterparty that are subject to a contractual
agreement that provides for the net settlement of all
contracts through a single payment in a single currency in
the event of default or termination of any one contract.
Offsetting the assets and liabilities recognized for condi-
tional or exchange contracts outstanding with a single
counterparty results in the net position between the two
counterparties being reported as an asset or a liability on
the balance sheet. The reporting entity’s choice to offset
or not to offset assets and liabilities recognized for con-
ditional
or
exchange
contracts
must
be
applied
consistently.
Glossary

Offsetting of assets and liabilities is also permitted by
other pronouncements identiﬁed in ASC Subtopic 210-20.
These pronouncements apply to such items as leverage
leases, pension plan and other postretirement beneﬁt plan
assets and liabilities, and deferred tax assets and liabili-
ties. In addition, ASC Subtopic 210-20, Balance Sheet –
Offsetting, describes the circumstances in which amounts
recognized as payables under repurchase agreements
may be offset against amounts recognized as receivables
under reverse repurchase agreements and reported as a
net amount in the balance sheet. The reporting entity’s
choice to offset or not to offset payables and receivables
under ASC Subtopic 210-20 must be applied consis-
tently.
According to the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for
Depository and Lending Institutions, ASC Subtopic
210-20 does not apply to securities borrowing or lending
transactions. Therefore, for purposes of ﬁling holding
company reports, holding companies should not offset
securities borrowing and lending transactions in the
balance sheet unless all the conditions set forth in ASC
Subtopic 210-20 are met.

the instructions to Schedule HC-M, item 13.
Overdraft: An overdraft can be either planned or
unplanned. An unplanned overdraft occurs when a
depository institution honors a check or draft drawn
against a deposit account when insufficient funds are on
deposit and there is no advance contractual agreement to
honor the check or draft. When a contractual agreement
has been made in advance to allow such credit exten-
sions, overdrafts are referred to as planned or pre-
arranged. Any overdraft, whether planned or unplanned,
is an extension of credit and is to be treated and reported
as a ‘‘loan’’ rather than being treated as a negative
deposit balance.
Planned overdrafts are to be classiﬁed in Schedule HC-C
by type of loan according to the nature of the overdrawn
depositor. For example, a planned overdraft by a com-
mercial customer is to be classiﬁed as a ‘‘commercial and
industrial loan.’’
Unplanned overdrafts in depositors’ accounts are to be
classiﬁed in Schedule HC-C, item 9, ‘‘All other loans,’’
unless the depositor is a depository institution or a
foreign government or official institution. Such unplanned
overdrafts would be reported in Schedule HC-C, item 2,
‘‘Loans to depository institutions and acceptances of
other banks’’ and item 7, ‘‘Loans to foreign governments
and official institutions.’’
For purposes of treatment of overdrafts, separate trans-
action accounts of a single depositor that are established
under a bona ﬁde cash management arrangement are
regarded as a single account rather than multiple or
separate accounts. In such a situation, an overdraft in one
of the accounts of a single customer is netted against the
related transaction accounts of the customer and an
extension of credit is regarded as arising only if, and to
the extent, the combined accounts of the customer are
overdrawn.
An overdraft also occurs when a borrower’s loan secured
by real estate has an escrow account for the payment of
taxes and/or insurance and the institution pays taxes or
insurance on behalf of the borrower when the escrow
account does not have sufficient funds to cover the full
amount of the payment. Because escrow funds are depos-
its for purposes of these reports, an overdrawn escrow
account should be reported as a “loan” in Schedule
HC-C.
The consolidated holding company’s overdrafts on deposit
accounts it holds with other depository institutions that
are not consolidated on the reporting holding company’s
FR Y-9C (i.e., its ‘‘due from’’ accounts) are to be
reported as borrowings in Schedule HC, item 16, except
overdrafts arising in connection with checks or drafts
drawn by subsidiary depository institutions of the report-
ing holding company and drawn on, or payable at or
through, another depository institution either on a zero-
balance account or on an account that is not routinely
maintained with sufficient balances to cover checks or
drafts drawn in the normal course of business during the
period until the amount of the checks or drafts is remitted
to the other depository institution (in which case, report
the funds received or held in connection with such checks
or drafts as deposits in Schedule HC-E until the funds are
remitted).

Pass-through Reserve Balances: Under the Monetary
Control Act of 1980, and as reﬂected in Federal Reserve
Regulation D, both member and nonmember depository
institutions may hold the balances they maintain to
satisfy reserve balance requirements (in excess of vault
cash) directly with a Federal Reserve Bank. However,
nonmember depository institutions may hold their bal-
ances maintained to satisfy reserve balance requirements
(in excess of vault cash) in one of two ways: either
(1) directly with a Federal Reserve Bank or (2) indirectly
in an account with another institution (referred to here as
a ‘‘correspondent’’), which, in turn, is required to pass
the reserves through to a Federal Reserve Bank. This
second type of account is called a ‘‘pass-through account,’’
and a depository institution passing its reserves to the
Federal Reserve through a correspondent is referred to as
a “respondent.” This pass-through reserve relationship is
legally and for supervisory purposes considered to con-
stitute an asset/debt relationship between the respondent
and the correspondent, and an asset/debt relationship
between the correspondent and the Federal Reserve. The
required reporting of the ‘‘pass-through reserve bal-
ances’’ reﬂects this structure of asset/debt relationships.
The reporting of pass-through reserve balances by corre-
spondent and respondent banks differs from the required
reporting of excess balance accounts by participants and
agents, which is described in the Glossary entry for
“Excess Balance Accounts.”
Perpetual Debt: Perpetual debt is an unsecured debt
instrument of the holding company or its subsidiaries
that, if issued by a bank, must also be subordinated to the
claims of the depositors. The major characteristics are
described below:
(1) The debt instrument cannot provide the note-holder
the right to demand repayment of principal except in
the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganiza-
tion.
(2) The issuer can not voluntarily redeem the debt issue
without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, unless
the debt is converted to, exchanged for, or simul-
taneously replaced in like amount by an issue of
common or perpetual preferred stock of the issuer or
the issuer’s parent company.
(3) When issued by the holding company, a bank subsid-
iary, or a subsidiary with substantial operations, the
debt instrument must contain a provision permitting
interest payments to be deferred when dividends on
all outstanding common or preferred stock of the
issuer have been eliminated.
(4) When issued by a holding company or a subsidiary
with substantial operations, the instrument must con-
vert automatically to common or perpetual preferred
stock of the issuer when the issuer’s retained earn-
ings and surplus accounts become negative.
For a complete discussion of the criteria for determining
the capital status of perpetual debt, see 12 CFR, Part 225,
Appendix B.

insurance policy.

Pools of Residential Mortgages, Participations in: See
“Transfers of Financial Assets.”
Pools of Securities, Participations in: See “Repurchase/

Preauthorized Transfer Account: See ‘‘Deposits.’’
Preferred Stock: Preferred stock is a form of ownership
interest in a holding company or other company which
entitles its holders to some preference or priority over the
owners of common stock, usually with respect to divi-
dends or asset distributions in a liquidation.
Limited-life preferred stock is preferred stock that has a
stated maturity date or that can be redeemed at the option
of the holder. It excludes those issues of preferred stock
that automatically convert into perpetual preferred stock
or common stock at a stated date.
Perpetual preferred stock is preferred stock that does not
have a stated maturity date or that cannot be redeemed
at the option of the holder. It includes those issues of
preferred stock that automatically convert into common
stock at a stated date.
Premiums and Discounts: A premium arises when a
holding company or its consolidated subsidiaries pur-
chase a security, loan, or other asset at a price in excess of
its par or face value, typically because the current level of
interest rates for such assets is less than its contract or
Glossary
GL-76
FR Y-9C
Glossary

stated rate of interest. The difference between the pur-
chase price and par or face value represents the premium
which all consolidated holding companies are required to
amortize.
A discount arises when a consolidated holding company
purchases a security, loan, or other asset at a price below
its par or face value, typically because the current level of
interest rates for such assets is greater than its contract or
stated rate of interest. A discount is also present on
instruments that do not have a stated rate of interest such
as U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper. The differ-
ence between par or face value and the purchase price
represents the discount which all holding companies on
the accrual basis of accounting are required to accrete.
Except as discussed in the next two paragraphs, premi-
ums and discounts are accounted for as adjustments to
the yield on an asset over its remaining life. A premium
must be amortized and a discount must be accreted from
the date of purchase to maturity, and not to the call or put
date. The preferable method for amortizing premiums
and accreting discounts involves the use of the interest
method for accruing income on the asset. The objective
of the interest method is to produce a constant yield or
rate of return on the carrying value of the asset (par or
face value plus unamortized premium or less unaccreted
discount) at the beginning of each amortization period
over the asset’s remaining life. The difference between
the periodic interest income that is accrued on the asset
and interest at the stated rate is the periodic amortization
or accretion. However, a straight-line method of amorti-
zation or accretion is acceptable if the results are not
materially different from the interest method.
If an institution holds a large number of similar debt
securities, loans, or other assets for which prepayments
are probable and the timing and amount of prepayments
can be reasonably estimated, the institution may consider
estimates of future principal prepayments in the calcula-
tion of the constant effective yield necessary to apply the
interest method.
For callable debt securities that have explicit, non-
contingent call features and are callable at ﬁxed prices
and on preset dates, (ASU 2017-08) amends ASC Sub-
topic 310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and
Other Costs, requires the amortization period to be
limited to its earliest call date for any premiums on such
debt securities. Under ASC Subtopic 310-20, the excess
of the amortized cost basis of such a callable debt
security over the amount repayable by the issuer at the
earliest call date (i.e., the premium) must be amortized to
the earliest call date (unless the institution applies the
guidance that allows estimates of future principal prepay-
ments to be considered in the effective yield calculation).
If the call option is not exercised at its earliest call date,
the institution must reset the effective yield using the
payment terms of the debt security.
A premium or discount may also arise when the reporting
holding company or its consolidated subsidiaries, acting
either as a lender or a borrower, are involved in an
exchange of a note for assets other than cash and the
interest rate is either below the market rate or not stated,
or the face amount of the note is materially different from
the fair value of the noncash assets exchanged. The
noncash assets and the related note shall be recorded at
either the fair value of the noncash assets or the market
value of the note, whichever is more clearly determin-
able. The market value of the note would be its present
value as determined by discounting all future payments
on the note using an appropriate interest rate, i.e., a rate
comparable to that on new loans of similar risk. The
difference between the face amount and the recorded
value of the note is a premium or discount. This discount
or premium shall be accounted for as an adjustment of
the interest income or expense over the life of the note
using the interest method described above.

est – Imputation of Interest.
Private Company: A private company is a business
entity that is not a public business entity. For further
information, see the Glossary entry for “Public Business
Entity.”
Public Business Entity:
The term “public business entity” is deﬁned in the Master
Glossary in the Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation (ASC).
The deﬁnition states that a business entity, such as a
holding company, that meets any one of ﬁve speciﬁed
criteria is a public business entity for reporting purposes
under U.S. GAAP. This also applies for FR Y-9C pur-
poses. In contrast, a private company is a business entity
that is not a public business entity. A holding company
that is a public business entity is not permitted to apply
private company accounting alternatives when preparing
its FR Y-9C report.
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-77

September 2021

As deﬁned in the ASC Master Glossary, a business entity
is a public business entity if
it meets any one of the
following criteria:
• It is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to ﬁle or furnish ﬁnancial state-
ments, or does ﬁle or furnish ﬁnancial statements
(including voluntary ﬁlers), with the SEC (including
other entities whose ﬁnancial statements or ﬁnancial
information are required to be or are included in a
ﬁling).
• It is required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the Act), as amended, or rules or regulations promul-
gated under the Act, to ﬁle or furnish ﬁnancial state-
ments with a regulatory agency other than the SEC
(such as one of the federal banking agencies).
• It is required to ﬁle or furnish ﬁnancial statements with
a foreign or domestic regulatory agency in preparation
for the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities that
are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer.
• It has issued debt or equity securities that are traded,
listed, or quoted on an exchange or an over-the-counter
market, which includes an interdealer quotation or
trading system for securities not listed on an exchange
(for example, OTC Markets Group, Inc., including the
OTC Pink Markets, or the OTC Bulletin Board).
• It has one or more securities that are not subject to
contractual restrictions on transfer, and it is required by
law, contract, or regulation to prepare U.S. GAAP
ﬁnancial statements (including footnotes) and make
them publicly available on a periodic basis (for exam-
ple, interim or annual periods). An entity must meet
both of these conditions to meet this criterion.
The Master Glossary also explains that if an entity meets
the deﬁnition of a public business entity solely because
its ﬁnancial statements or ﬁnancial information is included
in another entity’s ﬁling with the SEC, the holding
company is only a public business entity for purposes of
ﬁnancial statements that are ﬁled or furnished with the
SEC, but not for other reporting purposes or for FR Y-9C
purposes.
If a holding company does not meet any one of the ﬁrst
four criteria, it would need to consider whether it meets
both of the conditions included in the ﬁfth criterion to
determine whether it would be a public business entity.
With respect to the ﬁrst condition under the ﬁfth crite-
rion, a stock institution must determine whether it has a
class of securities not subject to contractual restrictions
on transfer, which the FASB has stated means that the
securities are not subject to management preapproval on
resale. A contractual management preapproval require-
ment that lacks substance would raise questions about
whether the stock institution meets this ﬁrst condition.
Purchase Acquisition: See “Business combinations.”
Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Assets: Purchased
credit-deteriorated (PCD) assets are acquired ﬁnancial
assets that, at acquisition, have experienced a more-than-
insigniﬁcant deterioration in credit quality since origina-
tion, as determined by an acquirer’s assessment.
In accordance with ASC Topic 326, holding companies
are required to estimate and record an allowance for
credit losses (ACL) for PCD assets at the time of
purchase. This acquisition date ACL is added to the
purchase price of the ﬁnancial assets rather than record-
ing these losses through provisions for credit losses. This
establishes the initial amortized cost basis of the PCD
assets. A holding company may use either a discounted
or an undiscounted cash ﬂow method at acquisition to
determine this ACL. Subsequent ACL measurements for
acquired ﬁnancial assets with more-than-insigniﬁcant
credit deterioration since origination are to be measured
under ASC Topic 326 as with (1) originated ﬁnancial
assets and (2) purchased ﬁnancial assets that do not have
a more-than-insigniﬁcant deterioration in credit quality at
acquisition.
Holding companies that measure expected credit losses
for PCD assets on a pool basis shall continue to evaluate
whether ﬁnancial assets in the pool continue to share
similar risk characteristics with the other ﬁnancial assets
in the pool. If there have been changes in credit risk,
borrower circumstances, recognition of a charge-off, or
cash collections of interest applied to principal while the
asset is in nonaccrual status, a holding company may
determine that either the ﬁnancial asset has similar risk
characteristics with another pool or the credit loss mea-
surement should be performed on an individual ﬁnancial
asset basis because the ﬁnancial asset does not share risk
characteristics with other ﬁnancial assets. Holding com-
panies that measure the ACL on a collective basis shall
allocate the ACL and any noncredit discount or premium
to the individual PCD assets unless the holding company
elected the transition option to account for existing
Glossary

purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loan pools as PCD pools
upon adoption of ASC Topic 326.
Any difference between the unpaid principal balance of
the PCD asset and the amortized cost basis of the asset as
of the acquisition date is the noncredit discount or
premium. Provided the asset remains in accrual status,
the noncredit discount or premium recorded at acquisi-
tion is accreted into interest income over the remaining
life of the PCD asset on a level-yield basis.
In contrast, regardless of whether a PCD asset is in
nonaccrual or accrual status, a holding company is not
permitted to accrete the credit-related discount embedded
in the purchase price of the asset that is attributable to the
acquirer’s assessment of expected credit losses as of the
date of acquisition (i.e., the contractual cash ﬂows the
acquirer did not expect to collect at acquisition). In
addition, interest income should no longer be recognized
on a PCD asset to the extent that the net investment in the
asset would increase to an amount greater than the payoff
amount.
ASC Subtopic 310-10, Receivables—Overall, does not
prohibit a holding company from placing a PCD asset in
nonaccrual status. Because a PCD asset is an acquired
ﬁnancial asset that, at acquisition, has experienced a
more-than-insigniﬁcant deterioration in credit quality
since origination, as determined by an acquiring holding
company’s assessment, the acquiring holding company
must determine upon acquisition whether it is appropriate
to place the PCD asset in accrual status, including
accreting the noncredit discount or premium.
For purposes of these reports, if a holding company has a
PCD asset, including a PCD asset that was previously a
PCI asset or part of a pool of PCI loans, that would
otherwise be required to be placed in nonaccrual status
(see the Glossary entry for “Nonaccrual Status”), the
holding company may elect to accrue interest income on
the PCD asset and not report the PCD asset as being in
nonaccrual status if the following criteria are met:
(a) The holding company reasonably estimates the
timing and amounts of cash ﬂows expected to be
collected, and
(b) The holding company did not acquire the asset
primarily for the rewards of ownership of the
underlying collateral, such as use of collateral in
operations of the holding company or improving
the collateral for resale.
When a PCD asset that meets the criteria above is not
placed in nonaccrual status, the asset should be subject to
other alternative methods of evaluation to ensure that the
holding company’s net income is not materially over-
stated. If a holding company is required or has elected to
carry a PCD asset in nonaccrual status, the asset must be
reported as a nonaccrual asset at its amortized cost basis
(fair value for a PCD available-for-sale debt security) in
Schedule HC-N, column C.
For PCD assets for which the holding company has made
a policy election to maintain previously existing pools of
PCI loans upon adoption of ASC Topic 326, the determi-
nation of nonaccrual or accrual status should be made at
the pool level, not the individual asset level.
For a PCD asset that is not reported in nonaccrual status,
the delinquency status of the PCD asset should be
determined in accordance with its contractual repayment
terms for purposes of reporting the amortized cost basis
of the asset (fair value for a PCD available-for-sale debt
security) as past due in Schedule HC-N, column A or B,
as appropriate. If the PCD asset that is not reported in
nonaccrual status consists of a pool of loans that was
previously PCI, but is being maintained as a unit of
account after the adoption of ASC Topic 326, delin-
quency status should be determined individually for each
loan in the pool in accordance with the individual loan’s
contractual repayment terms.
For further information on the reporting of interest
income on PCD assets, holding companies should refer
to the Glossary entry for “Nonaccrual Status” and ASC
Subtopic 310-10.
Deferred Tax Asset Considerations—A holding com-
pany’s provisions for credit losses that increase the
amount of the ACL also increase the amount of the
deductible temporary difference associated with the ACL
and the related deferred tax asset because the provisions
are expensed for ﬁnancial reporting purposes. These
increases in the ACL typically are not deducted in the
same period for income tax purposes. Tax deductions for
credit losses typically occur in the period when ﬁnancial
assets are actually charged off. However, an addition to
the ACL as of the acquisition date of a PCD asset (i.e.,
the “gross–up”) does not create such a deductible tempo-
rary difference or a deferred tax asset. A holding com-
pany’s deferred tax assets should be calculated at the
report date by applying the “applicable tax rate” based on
Glossary

the holding company’s total deductible temporary differ-
ences. See the Glossary entry for “Income Taxes” for
information on how to determine the tax effect of such a
temporary difference and the need for any deferred tax
asset valuation allowance.
See also the Glossary entries for “Allowance for Credit
Losses” and “Nonaccrual Status.”
Put Option: See “Derivative Contracts.”
Real Estate, Loan Secured By: See “Loans Secured by
Real Estate.”
Reciprocal Balances: Reciprocal balances arise when
two depository institutions maintain deposit accounts
with each other, that is, when a subsidiary bank of the
consolidated holding company has both a due to and a
due from balance with another depository institution. For
purposes of the FR Y-9C, reciprocal balances between
subsidiaries of the reporting holding company and other
depository institutions may be reported on a net basis in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
GAAP permits ﬁnancial institutions to net reciprocal
balances where right of offset exists.
For a deﬁnition of “Commercial Banks in the U.S.,” see
the Glossary entry for “Banks, U.S. and Foreign.”
Reinsurance: Reinsurance is the transfer, with indemni-
ﬁcation, of all or part of the underwriting risk from one
insurer to another for a portion of the premium or other
consideration. Reinsurance contacts may be on an excess-
of-loss or quota-share basis, the latter being when the
primary underwriter and the reinsurer proportionately
share all insured losses from the ﬁrst dollar. Reinsurance
includes insurance coverage arranged by a holding com-
pany affiliate such as a mortgage reinsurance company,
underwritten by another underwriter and then returned or
ceded in part or whole back to the mortgage reinsurance
affiliate.
Reinsurance Recoverables: Reinsurance recoverables
represent reimbursements expected by insurance under-
writers, under reinsurance contracts governing underwrit-
ing coverage ceded to another insurer, for paid and
unpaid claims, claim settlement expenses and other pol-
icy beneﬁts. Reinsurance recoverables do not include
insurance payments expected by the holding company as
a result of policy claims ﬁled by the company with
insurance underwriters.
Repurchase Agreements to Maturity and Long-Term
Repurchase Agreements: See “Repurchase/Resale
Agreements.”
Repurchase/Resale Agreements: A repurchase agree-
ment is a transaction involving the ‘‘sale’’ of ﬁnancial
assets by one party to another, subject to an agreement by
the ‘‘seller’’ to repurchase the assets at a speciﬁed date
or in speciﬁed circumstances. A resale agreement (also
known as a reverse repurchase agreement) is a trans-
action involving the ‘‘purchase’’ of ﬁnancial assets by
one party from another, subject to an agreement by the
‘‘purchaser’’ to resell the assets at a speciﬁed date or in
speciﬁed circumstances.
As stated in the AICPA’s Audit and Accounting Guide for
Banks and Savings Institutions, dollar repurchase agree-
ments (also called dollar rolls) are agreements to sell and
repurchase similar but not identical securities. The dollar
roll market consists primarily of agreements that involve
mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Dollar rolls differ
from regular repurchase agreements in that the securities
sold and repurchased, which are usually of the same
issuer, are represented by different certiﬁcates, are collat-
eralized by different but similar mortgage pools (for
example, single-family residential mortgages) and gener-
ally have different principal amounts.
General rule—Consistent with ASC Topic 860, Trans-
fers and Servicing, repurchase and resale agreements
involving ﬁnancial assets (e.g., securities and loans),
including dollar repurchase agreements, are either reported
as (a) secured borrowings and loans or (b) sales and
forward repurchase commitments based on whether the
transferring (‘‘selling’’) institution maintains control over
the transferred assets. (See Glossary entry for “Transfers
of Financial Assets” for further discussion of control
criteria).
If a repurchase agreement both entitles and obligates the
“selling” institution to repurchase or redeem the trans-
ferred assets from the transferee (“purchaser”) the “sell-
ing” institution should report the transaction as a secured
borrowing if and only if the following conditions have
been met:
(1) The assets to be repurchased or redeemed are the
same or “substantially the same” as those transferred,
as deﬁned by ASC Topic 860.
(2) The “selling” institution has the ability to repurchase
or redeem the transferred assets on substantially the
Glossary
GL-80
FR Y-9C
Glossary

agreed terms, even in the event of default by the
transferee (“purchaser”). This ability is presumed to
exist if the “selling” institution has obtained cash or
other collateral sufficient to fund substantially all of
the cost of purchasing replacement assets from oth-
ers.
(3) The agreement is to repurchase or redeem the trans-
ferred assets before maturity, at a ﬁxed or determin-
able price.
(4) The agreement is entered into concurrently with the
transfer.
Participations in pools of securities are to be reported
in the same manner as security repurchase/resale
transactions.
Repurchase
agreements
reported
as
secured
borrowings.—If a repurchase agreement qualiﬁes as a
secured borrowing, the ‘‘selling’’ institution should report
the transaction as indicated below based on whether the
agreement involves a security or some other ﬁnancial
asset.
(1) Securities ‘‘sold’’ under agreements to repurchase are
reported in Schedule HC, item 14(b), ‘‘Securities
sold under agreements to repurchase.’’
(2) Financial assets (other than securities) ‘‘sold’’ under
agreements to repurchase are reported as follows:
(a) If the repurchase agreement has an original
maturity of one business day (or is under a
continuing contract) and is in immediately avail-
able funds, it should be reported in Schedule HC,
item 14(a), ‘‘Federal funds purchased (in domes-
tic offices),’’ if it is a domestic office, and in
Schedule HC, item 16, ‘‘Other borrowed money,’’
if it is a foreign office.
(b) If the repurchase agreement has an original
maturity of more than one business day or is not
in immediately available funds, it should be
reported in Schedule HC, item 16, ‘‘Other bor-
rowed money.’’
In addition, the ‘‘selling’’ institution may need to record
further entries depending on the terms of the agreement.
If the ‘‘purchaser’’ has the right to sell or repledge
noncash assets, the ‘‘selling’’ institution should recatego-
rize the transferred ﬁnancial assets as ‘‘assets receivable’’
and report them in Schedule HC, item 11, ‘‘Other assets.’’
Otherwise, the ﬁnancial assets should continue to be
reported in the same asset category as before the transfer
(e.g., securities should continue to be reported in Sched-
ule HC, item 2, ‘‘Securities,’’ or item 5, ‘‘Trading
Assets,’’ as appropriate).
Resale agreements reported as secured borrowings.—
Similarly, if a resale agreement qualiﬁes as a secured
borrowing, the ‘‘purchasing’’ institution should report the
transaction as indicated below based on whether the
agreement involves a security of some other ﬁnancial
asset.
(1) Securities ‘‘purchased’’ under agreements to resell
reported in Schedule HC, item 3(b), ‘‘Securities
purchased under agreements to resell.’’
(2) Financial assets (other than securities) ‘‘purchased’’
under agreements to resell are reported as follows:
(a) If the resale agreement has an original maturity
of one business day (or is under a continuing
contract) and is in immediately available funds, it
should be reported in Schedule HC, item 3(a),
‘‘Federal funds sold (in domestic offices),’’ if it is
in a domestic office, and in Schedule HC, item
4(b), ‘‘Loans and leases, held for investment,’’ if
it is a foreign office.
(b) If the resale agreement has an original maturity
of more than one business day or is not in
immediately available funds, it should be reported
in Schedule HC, item 4(b), “Loans and leases,
held for investment.”
In addition, the “purchasing” institution may need to
record further entries depending on the terms of agree-
ment. If the “purchasing” institution has the right to sell
the noncash assets it has “purchased” and sells these
assets, it should recognize the proceeds from the sale and
report its obligation to return the assets in Schedule HC,
item 20, “Other liabilities.” If the “selling” institution
defaults under the terms of the repurchase agreement and
is no longer entitled to redeem the noncash assets, the
“purchasing” institution should recognize these assets on
its own balance sheet (e.g., securities should be reported
in Schedule HC, item 2, “Securities,” or item 5, “Trading
assets,” as appropriate) and initially measure them at fair
value. However, if the “purchasing” insitution has already
sold the assets it has “purchased,” it should derecognize
its obligation to return the assets. Otherwise, the ‘‘pur-
chasing’’ institution should not recognize the transferred
Glossary

ﬁnancial assets (i.e., the ﬁnancial assets “purchased”
under the resale agreement) on its balance sheet.
Repurchase/resale agreements reported as sales.—If a
repurchase agreement does not qualify as a secured
borrowing under ASC Topic 860, the selling institution
should account for the transaction as a sale of ﬁnancial
assets and a forward repurchase commitment. The selling
institution should remove the transferred assets from its
balance sheet, record the proceeds from the sale of
transferred assets (including the forward repurchase com-
mitment) and record any gain or loss on the transaction.
Similarly, if a resale agreement does not qualify as a
borrowing under ASC Topic 860, the purchasing institu-
tion should account for the transaction as a purchase of
ﬁnancial assets and a forward resale commitment. The
purchasing institution should record the transferred assets
on its balance sheet and initially measure them at fair
value, record the payment for the purchased assets
(including the forward resale commitment).
Reserve Balances, Pass-through: See “Pass-through
Reserve Balances.”
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: ASC Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which
became effective as a result of Accounting Standards
Update ASU 2014-09, provides guidance on how an
entity should recognize revenue from these transactions.
The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should
recognize revenue at an amount that reﬂects the consid-
eration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for
transferring goods or services to a customer as part of the
entity’s ordinary activities. ASU 2014-09 also added
ASC Topic 610, Other Income, to the ASC. ASC Topic
610 applies to income recognition that is not within the
scope of ASC Topic 606, other Topics (such as Topic 842
on leases), or other revenue or income guidance. ASC
Topic 610 applies to an institution’s sales of repossessed
nonﬁnancial assets, such as other real estate owned
(OREO). See the Glossary entry for “Foreclosed Assets”
for guidance on the accounting and reporting for the sale
of OREO and other repossessed nonﬁnancial assets.
ASC Topic 606 speciﬁcally excludes ﬁnancial instru-
ments and other contractual rights or obligations within
the scope of ASC Topic 310, Receivables; ASC Topic 320,
Investments - Debt Securities; ASC Topic 321, Invest-
ments - Equity Securities; ASC Topic 815, Derivatives
and Hedging; ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing,
and certain other ASC Topics. Therefore, many common
revenue streams in the ﬁnancial sector, such as interest
income, fair value adjustments, gains and losses on sales
of ﬁnancial instruments, and loan origination fees, are not
within the scope of ASC Topic 606. However, the
provisions of ASC Topic 606 may affect the timing for
the recognition of, and the presentation of, those revenue
streams within the scope of this accounting standard,
such as certain fees associated with credit card arrange-
ments, underwriting fees and costs, and deposit-related
fees. To achieve the core principle described above when
accounting for transactions within the scope of ASC
Topic 606, an institution should apply the following steps
as set forth in ASC Topic 606:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the
contract.
Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract.
Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the institution
satisﬁes a performance obligation. For further guidance
on applying these steps, refer to ASC Topic 606.
Sales of Assets for Risk-Based Capital Purposes: This
entry should be read in conjunction with the Federal
Reserve’s ﬁnal rule revising the regulatory capital treat-
ment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substi-
tutes, including residual interests and credit-enhancing
interest-only strips, which was published on Novem-
ber 29, 2001. This entry provides guidance for determin-
ing whether sales of loans, securities, receivables, and
other assets are subject to the agencies’ risk-based capital
standards and are reportable in Schedule HC-R, Regula-
tory Capital, and Schedule HC-S, Servicing, Securitiza-
tion and Asset Sale Activities. For information on the
reporting of transfers of ﬁnancial assets for purposes of
the balance sheet, income statement, and related sched-
ules, see the Glossary entry for “Transfers of Financial
Assets.”
For purposes of reporting in Schedules HC-R and HC-S,
some transfers of assets that qualify as sales under
generally accepted accounting principles are subject to
the capital guidelines because they meet the following
deﬁnition of “recourse” that is set forth in those guide-
lines.

Deﬁnition
of
“recourse”
for
risk-based
capital
purposes—As deﬁned in capital guidelines, recourse
means an arrangement in which a holding company
retains, in form or in substance, any credit risk directly or
indirectly associated with an asset it has sold (in accor-
dance with generally accepted accounting principles) that
exceeds a pro rata share of the holding company’s claim
on the asset. If a holding company has no claim on an
asset it has sold, then the retention of any credit risk is
recourse.
A recourse obligation typically arises when an institution
transfers assets on a sale and retains an obligation to
repurchase the assets or absorb losses due to a default of
principal or interest or any other deﬁciency in the perfor-
mance of the underlying obligor or some other party.
Recourse may also exist implicitly where a holding
company provides credit enhancement beyond any con-
tractual obligation to support assets it has sold.
The following are examples of recourse arrangements:
(1) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties made
on the transferred assets, i.e., representations and
warranties that are made in connection with a transfer
of assets (including loan servicing assets) and that
obligate a holding company to protect investors from
losses arising from credit risk in the assets transferred
or the loans serviced. Credit-enhancing representa-
tions and warranties include promises to protect a
party from losses resulting from the default or non-
performance of another party or from an insuffi-
ciency in the value of collateral. Credit-enhancing
representations and warranties do not include:
(a) Early-default clauses and similar warranties that
permit the return of, or premium refund clauses
covering, qualifying 1–4 family residential ﬁrst
mortgage loans, i.e., those that qualify for a
50 percent risk weight for risk-based capital
purposes, for a period of 120 days from the date
of transfer. These warranties may cover only
those loans that were originated within 1 year of
the date of transfer.
(b) Premium refund clauses covering assets guar-
anteed, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Gov-
ernment, a U.S. Government agency, or a U.S.
Government-sponsored agency, provided the pre-
mium refund clauses are for a period not to
exceed 120 days from the date of transfer.
(c) Warranties that permit the return of assets in
instances of fraud, misrepresentation, or incom-
plete documentation.
(2) Loan servicing assets retained pursuant to an agree-
ment under which the holding company does one or
more of the following:
(a) Is responsible for losses associated with the loans
serviced.
(b) Is responsible for making mortgage servicer cash
advances, i.e., funds that a residential mortgage
servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted ﬂow
of payments or the timely collection of residen-
tial mortgage loans, including disbursements
made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses
arising from a mortgage loan to facilitate its
timely collection. A mortgage servicer cash
advance is not a recourse obligation if:
(i) the mortgage servicer is entitled to full reim-
bursement or, for any one residential mort-
gage loan, nonreimbursable advances are
limited to an insigniﬁcant amount of the
outstanding principal on that loan, and
(ii) the servicer’s entitlement to reimbursement
is not subordinated.
(c) Makes credit-enhancing representations and war-
ranties on the serviced loans.
(3) Retained subordinated interests that absorb more
than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying
assets.
(4) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase, if the
assets are not already included on the balance sheet.
(5) Loan strips sold without contractual recourse where
the maturity of the transferred portion of the loan is
shorter than the maturity of the commitment under
which the loan is drawn.
(6) Credit derivative contracts under which the holding
company retains more than its pro rata share of credit
risk on transferred assets.
(7) Clean-up calls, except that calls that are exercisable
at the option of the holding company (as servicer or
as an affiliate of the servicer) only when the pool
balance is 10 percent or less of the original pool
balance are not recourse.
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-83
Glossary
September 2020

In addition, all recourse arrangements in the form of
on-balance sheet assets are ‘‘residual interests.’’ The
capital guidelines deﬁne ‘‘residual interest’’ to mean
any on-balance sheet asset that represents an interest
(including a beneﬁcial interest) created by a transfer that
qualiﬁes as a sale (in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles) of ﬁnancial assets, whether through
a securitization or otherwise, and that exposes a holding
company to credit risk directly or indirectly associated
with the transferred asset that exceeds a pro rata share of
the holding company’s claim on the asset, whether
through subordination provisions or other credit enhance-
ment techniques. In general, residual interests include
credit-enhancing interest-only strips, spread accounts,
cash collateral accounts, retained subordinated interests,
other forms of overcollateralization, accrued but uncol-
lected interest on transferred assets that (when collected)
will be available to serve in a credit-enhancing capacity,
and similar on-balance sheet assets that function as a
credit enhancement.
If an asset transfer that qualiﬁes for sale treatment under
generally accepted accounting principles meets the pre-
ceding deﬁnition of ‘‘recourse,’’ the transaction must
be treated as an ‘‘asset sale with recourse’’ for purposes
of reporting risk-based capital information in Sched-
ule HC-R. The transaction must also be reported as an
asset sale with recourse in Schedule HC-S, item 1 or
item 11, as appropriate, depending on whether the asset
was securitized by the reporting institution.
Assets transferred in transactions that do not qualify as
sales under generally accepted accounting principles
should continue to be reported as assets on the balance
sheet and are subject to the capital guidelines.
Summary Description of the Risk-Based Capital Treat-
ment of Recourse Arrangements—Under the capital
guidelines, in general, a holding company must hold
risk-based capital against the entire outstanding amount
of the assets sold with recourse. However, some of the
exceptions to this general rule include the following:
(1) Under the low-level exposure provisions of the capi-
tal guidelines, the risk-based capital requirement for
a recourse arrangement is limited to the maximum
contractual loss exposure when this amount is less
than the amount of risk-based capital that would be
required to be held against the entire outstanding
amount of the assets sold.
(2) For a residual interest or other recourse exposure in a
securitization (other than a credit-enhancing interest-
only strip) that qualiﬁes for the ratings-based
approach, the required amount of risk-based capital
is determined based on the relative risk of loss of the
residual interest or other recourse exposure.
(3) For a residual interest that does not qualify for the
ratings-based approach, including a credit-enhancing
interest-only strip that is not deducted from Tier 1
capital under the concentration limit, the residual
interest is subject to a dollar-for-dollar capital charge.
(4) Under Section 208 of the Riegle Community Devel-
opment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994,
risk-based capital must be held against the amount of
recourse retained on small business obligations trans-
ferred with recourse.
For further information on the reporting of recourse
arrangements for risk-based capital calculation purposes,
refer to the instructions for Schedule HC-R, Regulatory
Capital, including the sections of instructions on ‘‘Risk-
Weighted Assets’’ and ‘‘Balance Sheet Asset Catego-
ries’’ and the instructions for the following Sched-
ule HC-R part II items:
• Item 15, “Retained recourse on small business obliga-
tions sold with recourse;”
Interpretations and illustrations of the deﬁnition of
‘‘recourse’’ for risk-based capital purposes:
(1) For any given asset transfer, the determination of
whether credit risk is retained by the transferring
institution in excess of a pro rata share of its claim on
the asset is to be based upon the substance of the
transfer agreement or other relevant documents or
informal commitments and understandings, or subse-
quent actions of the parties to the transactions, not
upon the form or particular terminology used. The
presence of a bona ﬁde ‘‘sale with recourse’’ provi-
sion would establish the transaction as an asset sale
with recourse for purposes of risk-based capital and
Schedules HC-R and HC-S. However, the absence
of a recourse provision, the absence of the term
‘‘recourse,’’ even the presence of a statement to the
effect that there is no recourse or, in the case of a
participation, the use of the terms ‘‘pass-through’’ or
‘‘pure pass-through’’ will not by themselves establish
a transaction as a sale that is not subject to risk-based
capital. If other conditions and provisions of the
Glossary
GL-84
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2020

transfer are such as to leave the transferor with credit
risk as described in the deﬁnition of recourse, the
transfer is an asset sale with recourse for purposes of
risk-based capital and Schedules HC-R and HC-S.
(2) If assets are sold subject to speciﬁc contractual terms
that limit the seller’s recourse liability to a percent-
age of the amount of assets sold or to a speciﬁc
dollar amount and this percentage or amount exceeds
a pro rata share of the seller’s claim on the assets,
the transaction represents an asset sale with recourse
for risk-based capital purposes. For example, if assets
are sold subject to a ten percent recourse liability
provision (i.e., the seller’s credit risk is limited to ten
percent of the amount of assets sold) with no other
retention of credit risk by the seller, the total out-
standing amount of the assets sold is subject to
risk-based capital, not just ten percent of the assets
sold, unless the low level exposure rule applies.
(3) Among the transfers where credit risk has been
retained by the seller and that should be considered
by the seller as asset sales with recourse for purposes
of risk-based capital and Schedules HC-R and HC-S
are arrangements such as the following (this list is
illustrative of the principles involved in the applica-
tion of the deﬁnition of ‘‘recourse’’ and is not
all-inclusive)—
(a) the sale of an asset with a realistic bona ﬁde put
option allowing the purchaser, at its option, to
return the asset to the seller;
(b) the sale of an asset guaranteed by a standby letter
of credit issued by the seller;
(c) the sale of an asset guaranteed by a standby letter
of credit issued by any other party in which the
credit risk on the asset sold, either directly or
indirectly, rests with the seller;
(d) the sale of an asset guaranteed by an insurance
contract in which the seller, either directly or
indirectly, indemniﬁes or otherwise protects the
insurer in any manner against credit risk; and
(e) sales and securitizations of assets which use
contractual cash ﬂows (e.g., interest-only strips
receivable and so-called ‘‘spread accounts’’),
retained subordinated interests, or retained secu-
rities (e.g., collateral invested amounts and cash
collateral accounts) as credit enhancements.
(4) The sale of a loan or other asset subject to an
agreement under which the seller will pass through to
the purchaser a rate of interest that differs from the
stated rate of interest on the transferred asset would
not, for this reason alone, require the transaction to
be treated as an asset sale with recourse for risk-
based capital purposes provided (1) the seller’s obli-
gation to pass interest through to the purchaser is
contingent upon the continued interest payment per-
formance of the underlying obligor of the transferred
asset (i.e., the seller has no obligation to pass interest
through if the obligor defaults in whole or in part on
interest or principal) and (2) none of the other
characteristics of the sale or participation causes the
transaction to meet the deﬁnition of ‘‘recourse.’’
(5) The deﬁnition of ‘‘recourse’’ applies to all transfers
of assets, including sales of a single asset or of a pool
of assets and sales of participations in a single asset
or in a pool of assets (whether of similar or dissimilar
instruments). In participations that qualify for sale
treatment under generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples and are not ‘‘syndications’’ (as described in the
Glossary item for that term), the seller of the partici-
pations should handle the transfer of shares to partici-
pants in accordance with the deﬁnition of ‘‘recourse,’’
even though the assets being participated were
acquired or accumulated for the express purpose of
issuing participations and even though the participa-
tion was prearranged with the purchasers of the
participations. However, the deﬁnition of ‘‘recourse’’
does not apply to the initial operation and distribu-
tion of participations in the form of syndications,
since in a syndication there is no transfer of assets
involved of the type to which this deﬁnition is
addressed. Any subsequent transfers of shares, or
parts of shares, in a syndicated loan would be subject
to the ‘‘recourse’’ deﬁnition.
(6) The deﬁnition of “recourse” (and these interpreta-
tions and illustrations) is also applicable to asset
transfers that are made to special or limited purpose
entities that are not technically affiliated with the
seller. Regardless of the legal structure of the trans-
action, if credit risk is retained by the seller, either
contractually or otherwise, either directly or indi-
rectly, the seller should treat the transaction as an
asset sale with recourse for purposes of risk-based
capital and Schedules HC-R and HC-S even if the

Management should periodically reassess its security
categorization decisions to ensure that they remain appro-
priate.
Debt and equity securities that are intended to be held
principally for the purpose of selling them in the near
term should be classiﬁed as trading assets. Trading
activity includes active and frequent buying and selling
of securities for the purpose of generating proﬁts on
short-term ﬂuctuations in price. Securities held for trad-
ing purposes must be reported at fair value on the balance
sheet on HC, item 5, with unrealized gains and losses
recognized in current earnings and regulatory capital.
Holding companies may also elect to report debt securi-
ties within the scope of ASC Topic 320 at fair value in
accordance with ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instru-
ments – Overall. Debt securities for which the fair value
option is elected should be classiﬁed as trading assets and
reported on the balance sheet in Schedule HC, item 5,
with unrealized gains and losses recognized in current
earnings and regulatory capital. In general, the fair value
option may be elected for an individual security only
when it is ﬁrst recognized and the election is irrevocable.
Held-to-maturity securities are debt securities that a
holding company has the positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities, which are
generally reported at amortized cost should be reported
on the balance sheet in Schedule HC, item 2(a). The
amortized cost and fair value of held-to-maturity securi-
ties are reported by securities category in Schedule
HC-B, columns A and B, respectively. Debt securities
not categorized as trading or held-to-maturity must be
reported as available-for-sale. A holding company must
report its available-for-sale securities at fair value on the
balance sheet generally in Schedule HC, item 2(b), but
unrealized gains and losses on such securities are excluded
from earnings and reported in a separate component of
equity capital (i.e., in Schedule HC, item 26(b), ‘‘Accu-
mulated other comprehensive income’’). The amortized
cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities
are reported by securities category in Schedule HC-B,
columns C and D, respectively.
FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, “Rec-
ognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Finan-
cial Liabilities” (ASU 2016-01), added Topic 321, Invest-
ments – Equity Securities, to the ASC. ASU 2016-01
eliminated the classiﬁcation of equity securities with
readily determinable fair values not held for trading as
available-for-sale equity securities which were measured
at fair value with changes in fair value generally recog-
nized in other comprehensive income. As a consequence,
all holding companies must measure investments in
equity securities, except those accounted for under the
equity method and those that result in consolidation, at
fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net
income. However, for an equity security not held for
trading that does not have a readily determinable fair
value, ASC Topic 321 permits a holding company to
elect to measure the security at cost minus impairment, if
any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable
price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a
similar investment of the same issuer. When this mea-
surement alternative is elected for an equity security
without a readily determinable fair value not held for
trading, ASC Topic 321 requires the equity security to be
written down to its fair value, with a charge to earnings,
if a qualitative assessment indicates the security is
impaired and the fair value of the security is less than its
carrying value. For each equity security accounted for
using this measurement alternative, the qualitative assess-
ment must be made each reporting period by qualitatively
considering impairment indicators to evaluate whether
the security is impaired. Impairment indicators that a
holding company should consider include, but are not
limited to, the indicators identiﬁed in ASC Subtopic
321-10.
Except for equity investments accounted for under the
equity method and those that result in consolidation,
equity securities with readily determinable fair values not
held for trading should be reported at fair value on the
balance sheet in Schedule HC, item 2(c), and equity
investments without readily determinable fair values not
held for trading should be reported at fair value or using
the measurement alternative described above in Sched-
ule HC-F, item 4.
The measurement guidance for investments in equity
securities in ASC Topic 321 described above also applies
Glossary
GL-86
FR Y-9C

to investments in other ownership interests, such as
interests in partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures,
and limited liability companies. However, the measure-
ment guidance does not apply to Federal Home Loan
Bank stock or Federal Reserve Bank stock which should
be reported in Schedule HC-F, item 4.
Impairment of Individual Available-for-Sale Debt Secu-
rities (ASC Topic 326) – For additional information on
the maintenance of appropriate allowances for credit
losses (ACL), institutions should also refer to the Inter-
agency Policy Statement on Allowances for Credit
Losses (Revised April 2023).
Standards for the accounting for impairment of available-
for-sale debt securities are set forth in ASC Subtopic
326-30, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses–Available-
for-Sale Debt Securities. Under this subtopic, an available-
for-sale debt security is impaired if its fair value is less
than its amortized cost basis. Thus, as of the end of each
quarter, or more frequently if warranted, a holding com-
pany must determine whether a decline in fair value
below the amortized cost basis of an individual available-
for-sale debt security has resulted from a credit loss or
other factors. Credit losses are calculated individually,
rather than collectively, using a discounted cash ﬂow
method to compare the present value of the cash ﬂows
expected to be collected with the amortized cost basis of
the security. An ACL is established, with a charge to the
provision for credit losses, to reﬂect the credit loss
component of the decline in fair value below amortized
cost. The ACL for an available-for-sale debt security is
limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the
amortized cost basis, which is referred to as the fair value
ﬂoor. Noncredit impairment on an available-for-sale debt
security that is not required to be recorded through the
ACL should be reported, net of applicable income taxes,
in Schedule HI-A, item 12, “Other comprehensive
income.”
A holding company must reassess the credit losses on an
individual available-for-sale debt security each quarter
when there is an ACL on the security. The holding
company should record subsequent changes in the ACL
in the period of the change with a corresponding adjust-
ment recorded through a provision for credit losses
included in Schedule HI, item 4. A previously recorded
ACL on an available-for-sale debt security should not be
reversed to an amount below zero.
When evaluating impairment for available-for-sale debt
securities, a holding company may evaluate the amor-
tized cost basis including accrued interest receivable, or
may evaluate the accrued interest receivable separately
from the remaining amortized cost basis. If evaluated
separately, accrued interest receivable is excluded from
both the fair value of the available-for-sale debt security
and its amortized cost basis.
If a holding company intends to sell an available-for-sale
debt security or will more likely than not be required to
sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost
basis, the security’s ACL should be written off and the
amortized cost basis of the security should be charged
down to its fair value at the reporting date with any
incremental impairment reported in Schedule HI, item
6.b, “Realized gains (losses) on available for sale securi-
ties.” The previous amortized cost basis of the debt
security, less the amount of the charge-off, becomes the
new amortized cost basis of the security. This new
amortized cost basis is not increased for subsequent
recoveries in fair value; rather, a subsequent increase in
fair value after charge-off is included in other comprehen-
sive income. The difference between the new amortized
cost basis and the cash ﬂows expected to be collected
should be accreted to interest income according to appli-
cable accounting standards.
A holding company that has available-for-sale debt secu-
rities accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic
325-40, Investments–Other–Beneﬁcial Interests in Secu-
ritized Financial Assets, should refer to that subtopic to
account for changes in cash ﬂows expected to be col-
lected.
Accounting for Expected Credit Losses on Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities (ASC Topic 326) –
Holding companies should refer to the Glossary entry for
“Allowance for Credit Losses” for information on esti-
mating the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity
debt securities. Such holding companies should include
provisions for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt
securities in Schedule HI, item 4.
Practices Considered Trading Activities – The proper
categorization of securities is important to ensure that
trading gains and losses are promptly recognized in
earnings and regulatory capital. This will not occur when
securities intended to be held for trading purposes are
categorized as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. The
following practices are considered trading activities:
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-87
Glossary
March 2020

(1) Gains Trading — Gains trading is characterized by
the purchase of a security and the subsequent sale of
the same security at a proﬁt after a short holding
period, while securities acquired for this purpose that
cannot be sold at a proﬁt are typically retained in the
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity portfolio. Gains
trading may be intended to defer recognition of
losses, as unrealized losses on available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity debt securities do not directly affect
regulatory capital and generally are not reported in
income until the security is sold.
(2) When-Issued Securities Trading — When-issued
securities trading is the buying and selling of securi-
ties in the period between the announcement of an
offering and the issuance and payment date of the
securities. A purchase of a ‘‘when-issued’’ security
acquires the risks and rewards of owning a security
and may sell the when-issued security at a proﬁt
before having to take delivery and pay for it. Because
such transactions are intended to generate proﬁts
from short-term price movements, they should be
categorized as trading.
(3) Pair-offs — Pair-offs are security purchase transac-
tions that are closed-out or sold at, or prior to,
settlement date. In a pair-off, an institution commits
to purchase a security. Then, prior to the predeter-
mined settlement date, the institution will pair-off the
purchase with a sale of the same security. Pair-offs
are settled net when one party to the transaction
remits the difference between the purchase and the
sale price to the counterparty. Pair-offs may also
involve the same sequence of events using swaps,
options on swaps, forward commitments, options on
forward commitments, or other off-balance sheet
derivative contracts.
(4) Extended Settlements — In the U.S., regular-way
settlement for federal government and federal agency
securities (except mortgage-backed securities and
derivative contracts) is one business day after the
trade date. Regular-way settlement for corporate and
municipal securities is three business days after the
trade date. For mortgage-backed securities, it can be
up to 60 days or more after the trade date. The use of
extended settlements may be offered by securities
dealers in order to facilitate speculation on the part of
the purchaser, often in connection with pair-off trans-
actions. Securities acquired through the use of a
settlement period in excess of the regular-way settle-
ment periods in order to facilitate speculation should
be reported as trading assets.
(5) Repositioning Repurchase Agreements — A reposi-
tioning repurchase agreement is a funding technique
offered by a dealer in an attempt to enable an
institution to avoid recognition of a loss. Speciﬁcally,
an institution that enters into a ‘‘when-issued’’ trade
or a ‘‘pair-off’’ (which may include an extended
settlement) that cannot be closed out at a proﬁt on the
payment or settlement date will be provided dealer
ﬁnancing in an effort to fund its speculative position
until the security can be sold at a gain. The institution
purchasing the security typically pays the dealer a
small margin that approximates the actual loss in the
security. The dealer then agrees to fund the purchase
of the security, typically buying it back from the
purchaser under a resale agreement. Any securities
acquired through a dealer ﬁnancing technique such as
a repositioning repurchase agreement that is used to
fund the speculative purchase of securities should be
reported as trading assets.
(6) Short Sales — A short sale is the sale of a security
that is not owned. The purpose of a short sale
generally is to speculate on a fall in the price of the
security. (For further information, see the Glossary
entry for “Short Position.”)
Prohibited Practices– One other practice, referred to as
‘‘adjusted trading,’’ is not acceptable under any circum-
stances. Adjusted trading involves the sale of a security
to a broker or dealer at a price above the prevailing
market value and the contemporaneous purchase and
booking of a different security, frequently a lower-rated
or lower quality issue or one with a longer maturity, at a
price above its market value. Thus, the dealer is reim-
bursed for losses on the purchase from the institution and
ensured a proﬁt. Such transactions inappropriately defer
the recognition of losses on the security sold and estab-
lish an excessive cost basis for the newly acquired
security. Consequently, such transactions are prohibited
and may be in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1001—
Statements or Entries and 1005—False Entries.
See also the Glossary entries for “Accrued Interest
Receivable,” “Allowance for Credit Losses,” “Purchased
Credit-Deteriorated Assets,” and “Trading Account.”
Securities Borrowing/Lending Transactions: Securi-
ties borrowing/lending transactions are typically initiated
Glossary
GL-88
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2020

by broker–dealers and other ﬁnancial institutions that
need speciﬁc securities to cover a short sale or a cus-
tomer’s failure to deliver securities sold. A transferee
(‘‘borrower’’) of securities generally is required to pro-
vide ‘‘collateral’’ to the transferor (‘‘lender’’) of securi-
ties, commonly cash but sometimes other securities or
standby letters of credit, with a value slightly higher than
that of the securities ‘‘borrowed.’’
Most securities borrowing/lending transactions do not
qualify as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and
Servicing, because the securities borrowing/lending agree-
ment entitles and obligates the securities lender to repur-
chase or redeem the transferred assets before their matu-
rity. (See the Glossary entry for “Transfers of Financial
Aassets” for further discussion of sale criteria.) When
such a transaction does not qualify as a sale, the securities
lender (the transferor) and the securities borrower (the
transferee) should account for the transaction as a secured
borrowing in which cash (or securities that the holder is
permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge)
received as “collateral” by the securities lender is consid-
ered the amount borrowed and the securities “loaned” by
the securities lender are considered pledged as collateral
against the amount borrowed. The securities lender
should recognize the cash or securities received as “col-
lateral” as an asset on its balance sheet with a correspond-
ing liability for the obligation to return the “collateral”
received. The securities lender should continue to report
the “loaned” securities on its balance sheet in the same
asset category as before the transfer, e.g., as available-for-
sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, or trading
assets, as appropriate. “Loaned” securities that the secu-
rities lender reports as available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity securities in Schedule HC-B, Securities, should
also be reported as “Pledged securities” in Memorandum
item 1 of that schedule. Similarly, holding companies,
“loaned” securities that the securities lender reports as
trading assets in Schedule HC-D, Trading Assets and
Liabilities, should be reported as “Pledged securities” in
Memorandum item 4.a of that schedule, if applicable.
When a securities borrowing/lending transaction does not
qualify as a sale, the securities borrower should not
recognize at inception the “loaned” securities transferred
to it as assets on its balance sheet. Rather, at the inception
of a transaction in which the securities borrower pledges
cash collateral, the securities borrower should derecog-
nize the cash pledged to the securities lender and recog-
nize a corresponding receivable for the borrower’s claim
on the cash that the securities lender is obligated to return
in the future. If the securities borrower pledges securities
as collateral to the securities lender, the securities bor-
rower should record no balance sheet entry for the
pledged securities at inception, but it should report these
securities as pledged securities in the Call Report in the
same manner as discussed above for a securities lender. If
the securities lender later defaults under the terms of the
securities borrowing/lending agreement and is no longer
entitled to redeem the “loaned” securities, the securities
lender should remove these securities from its balance
sheet. Additionally, the securities borrower should now
recognize the “loaned” securities as assets on its balance
sheet (and report these securities, e.g., as available-for-
sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, or trading
assets, as appropriate, if debt securities had been loaned)
and initially measure them at fair value.
If the securities borrowing/lending transaction meets the
criteria for a sale under ASC Topic 860, the lender of the
securities should remove the securities from its balance
sheet, record the proceeds from the sale of the securities
(including the forward repurchase commitment), and rec-
ognize any gain or loss on the transaction. The borrower
of the securities should record the securities on its bal-
ance sheet at fair value and record the payment for the
purchased assets (including the forward resale commit-
ment).

resale agreements.’’
Separate Accounts: Separate accounts are employed by
life insurers to segregate and account for assets and
related liabilities maintained to meet speciﬁc investment
objectives of contractholders. The accounts are often
maintained as separate accounting entities for pension
plans as well as ﬁxed beneﬁt, variable annuity and other
products on which the customer and not the insurer
retains all or most of the investment and/or interest rate
risk. Investment income and investment gains and losses
generally accrue directly to such contractholders and are
not accounted for on the general accounts of the insurer.
The carrying values of separate account assets and liabili-
ties usually approximate each other with little associated
capital reﬂected on the books of the insurer. The assets of
each account are legally segregated and are not subject to
claims that arise out of any other business of the
company.

Servicing Assets and Liabilities: The accounting and
reporting standards for servicing assets and liabilities are
set forth in ASC Subtopic 860-50, Transfers and Servic-
ing – Servicing Assets and Liabilities, and ASC Topic 948,
Financial Services-Mortgage Banking. A summary of the
relevant sections of these accounting standards follows.
For further information, see ASC Subtopic 860-50, ASC
Topic 948, and the Glossary entry for “Transfers of
Financial Assets.”
Servicing of mortgage loans, credit card receivables, or
other ﬁnancial assets includes, but is not limited to,
collecting principal, interest, and escrow payments from
borrowers; paying taxes and insurance from escrowed
funds; monitoring delinquencies; executing foreclosure if
necessary; temporarily investing funds pending distribu-
tion; remitting fees to guarantors, trustees, and others
providing services; and accounting for and remitting
principal and interest payments to the holders of beneﬁ-
cial interests in the ﬁnancial assets. Servicers typically
receive certain beneﬁts from the servicing contract and
incur the costs of servicing the assets.
Servicing is inherent in all ﬁnancial assets; it becomes a
distinct asset or liability for accounting purposes only in
certain circumstances as discussed below. Servicing
assets result from contracts to service ﬁnancial assets
under which the beneﬁts of servicing (estimated future
revenues from contractually speciﬁed servicing fees, late
charges, and other ancillary sources) are expected to
more than adequately compensate the servicer for per-
forming the servicing. Servicing liabilities result from
contracts to service ﬁnancial assets under which the
beneﬁts of servicing are not expected to adequately
compensate the servicer for performing the servicing.
Contractually speciﬁed servicing fees are all amounts
that, per contract, are due to the servicer in exchange for
servicing the ﬁnancial asset and would no longer be
received by a servicer if the beneﬁcial owners of the
serviced assets or their trustees or agents were to exercise
their actual or potential authority under the contract to
shift the servicing to another servicer. Adequate compen-
sation is the amount of beneﬁts of servicing that would
fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be
required, including the proﬁt that would be demanded by
a substitute servicer in the marketplace.
A holding company must recognize and initially measure
at fair value a servicing asset or a servicing liability each
time it undertakes an obligation to service a ﬁnancial
asset by entering into a servicing contract in any of the
following situations:
(1) The holding company’s transfer of an entire ﬁnancial
asset, a group of entire ﬁnancial assets, or a partici-
pating interest in an entire ﬁnancial asset that meets
the requirements for sale accounting; or
(2) An acquisition or assumption of a servicing obliga-
tion that does not relate to ﬁnancial assets of the
holding company or its consolidated affiliates included
in the FR Y-9C report.
If a holding company sells a participating interest in an
entire ﬁnancial asset, it only recognizes a servicing asset
or servicing liability related to the participating interest
sold.
A holding company that transfers its ﬁnancial assets to an
unconsolidated entity in a transfer that qualiﬁes as a sale
in which the holding company obtains the resulting
securities and classiﬁes them as debt securities held-to-
maturity in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments–
Debt Securities, may either separately recognize its ser-
vicing assets or servicing liabilities or report those
servicing assets or servicing liabilities together with the
assets being serviced.
A holding company should account for its servicing
contract that qualiﬁes for separate recognition as a servic-
ing asset or servicing liability initially measured at fair
value regardless of whether explicit consideration was
exchanged. A holding company that transfers or securi-
tizes ﬁnancial assets in a transaction that does not meet
the requirements for sale accounting under ASC Topic
860 and is accounted for as a secured borrowing with the
underlying ﬁnancial assets remaining on the holding
company’s balance sheet must not recognize a servicing
asset or a servicing liability.
After initially measuring a servicing asset or servicing
liability at fair value, a holding company should subse-
quently measure each class of servicing assets and servic-
ing liabilities using either the amortization method or the
fair value measurement method. The election of the
subsequent measurement method should be made sepa-
rately for each class of servicing assets and servicing
liabilities. A holding company must apply the same
subsequent measurement method to each servicing asset
and servicing liability in a class. Each holding company
should identify its classes of servicing assets and servic-
ing liabilities based on (a) the availability of market
Glossary
GL-90
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2024

inputs used in determining the fair value of servicing
assets and servicing liabilities, (b) the holding company’s
method for managing the risks of its servicing assets or
servicing liabilities, or (c) both. Different elections can be
made for different classes of servicing. For a class of
servicing assets and servicing liabilities that is subse-
quently measured using the amortization method, a hold-
ing company may change the subsequent measurement
method for that class of servicing by making an irrevo-
cable decision to elect the fair value measurement method
for that class at the beginning of any ﬁscal year. Once a
holding company elects the fair value measurement
method for a class of servicing, that election must not be
reversed.
Under the amortization method, all servicing assets or
servicing liabilities in the class should be amortized in
proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net
servicing income for assets (servicing revenues in excess
of servicing costs) or net servicing loss for liabilities
(servicing costs in excess of servicing revenues). The
servicing assets or servicing liabilities should be assessed
for impairment or increased obligation based on fair
value at each quarter-end report date. The servicing
assets within a class should be stratiﬁed into groups
based on one or more of the predominant risk character-
istics of the underlying ﬁnancial assets. If the carrying
amount of a stratum of servicing assets exceeds its fair
value, the holding company should separately recognize
impairment for that stratum by reducing the carrying
amount to fair value through a valuation allowance for
that stratum. The valuation allowance should be adjusted
to reﬂect changes in the measurement of impairment
subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment. For
the servicing liabilities within a class, if subsequent
events have increased the fair value of the liability above
the carrying amount of the servicing liabilities, the
holding company should recognize the increased obliga-
tion as a loss in current earnings.
Under the fair value measurement method, all servicing
assets or servicing liabilities in a class should be mea-
sured at fair value at each quarter-end report date.
Changes in the fair value of these servicing assets and
servicing liabilities should be reported in earnings in the
period in which the changes occur.
For purposes of the FR Y-9C, servicing assets resulting
from contracts to service loans secured by real estate (as
deﬁned for Schedule HC-C, item 1, in the Glossary entry
for “Loans Secured by Real Estate”) should be reported
in Schedule HC-M, item 12(a), ‘‘Mortgage servicing
assets.’’ Servicing assets resulting from contracts to
service all other ﬁnancial assets should be reported in
Schedule HC-M, item 12(c), ″All other intangible assets.″
When reporting the carrying amount of mortgage servic-
ing assets in Schedule HC-M, item 12(a), and nonmort-
gage servicing assets in Schedule HC-M, item 12(b),
holding companies should include all classes of servicing
accounted for under the amortization method as well as
all classes of servicing accounted for under the fair value
measurement method. The fair value of all recognized
mortgage servicing assets should be reported in Schedule
HC-M, item 12(a)(1), regardless of the subsequent mea-
surement method applied to these assets. The servicing
asset carrying amounts reported in Schedule HC-M,
items 12(a) should be used when determining the amount
of such assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities,
that exceed the common equity tier 1 capital deduction
thresholds in Schedule HC-R, Part I. Changes in the fair
value of any class of servicing assets and servicing
liabilities accounted for under the fair value measurement
method should be included in earnings in Schedule HI,
item 5(f), ‘‘Net servicing fees.’’ In addition, certain
information about assets serviced by the reporting hold-
ing company should be reported in Schedule HC-S,
Servicing, Securitization, and Asset Sale Activities.
Settlement Date Accounting: See “Trade Date and
Settlement Date Accounting.”
Shell Branches: Shell branches are limited service
branches of banks that do not conduct transactions with
residents, other than with other shell branches, in the
country in which they are located. Transactions at shell
branches are usually initiated and effected by their head
office or by other related branches outside the country in
which the shell branches are located, with records and
supporting documents maintained at the initiating offices.
Examples of such locations are the Bahamas and the
Cayman Islands.
Short Position: When a holding company or its consoli-
dated subsidiaries sell an asset that they do not own or
sell more of an asset than they own, they have established
a short position. If a holding company or its subsidiaries
are in a short position with respect to a particular asset on
the report date, the holding company shall report its
liability to purchase the asset in Schedule HC, item 15,
‘‘Trading liabilities.’’ In this situation, the right to receive
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-91
Glossary
June 2021

payment shall be reported in Schedule HC, item 11,
‘‘Other assets.’’ Because short positions are reported as
trading liabilities, each short position should be reported
and measured at fair value as deﬁned by ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurement. Changes in the fair value
measurement of trading liabilities should be recognized
on Schedule HI, item 5.c, “Trading revenue.” Short
trading positions shall be revalued consistent with the
method used by the reporting holding company for the
valuation of its trading account assets.
For FR Y-9C Report purposes, if a holding company or
its subsidiaries hold a trading asset (i.e., a long position)
and sell more of the identical trading asset than they own,
the holding company may report the net amount of the
long and short positions as a trading liability only if an
identical unique identiﬁer, such as a CUSIP or ISIN
number,27 is used to determine such net amount and the
holding company has determined that this reporting
treatment is appropriate under U.S. GAAP.
Standby Contract: See “Futures, forward, and standby
contracts.″
Standby Letter of Credit: See “Letter of credit.“
Start-Up Activities: Guidance on the accounting and
reporting for the costs of start-up activities, including
organization costs, is set forth in ASC Subtopic 720-15,
Other Expenses – Start-Up Costs. A summary of this
accounting guidance follows. For further information,
see ASC Subtopic 720-15.
Start-up activities are deﬁned broadly as those one-time
activities related to opening a new facility, introducing a
new product or service, conducting business in a new
territory, conducting business with a new class of cus-
tomer, or commencing some new operation. Start-up
activities include activities related to organizing a new
entity, such as a new holding company, the costs of which
are commonly referred to as organization costs. Organi-
zation costs for a holding company are the direct costs
incurred to incorporate the holding company. Such costs
include, but are not limited to, professional (e.g., legal,
accounting, and consulting) fees and printing costs
directly related to the incorporation process, and the cost
of economic impact studies. Costs of start-up activities,
including organization costs, should be expensed as
incurred. Costs of acquiring or constructing premises and
ﬁxed assets and getting them ready for their intended use
are not start-up costs, but costs of using such assets that
are allocated to start-up activities (e.g., depreciation of
computers) are considered start-up costs.
For a new holding company, pre-opening expenses such
as salaries and employee beneﬁts, rent, depreciation,
supplies, directors’ fees, training, travel, postage, and
telephone are considered start-up costs. Pre-opening
income earned and expenses incurred from the holding
company’s inception through the date the holding com-
pany commences operations should be reported in the
income statement using one of the two following meth-
ods, consistent with the manner in which the reporting
holding company reports pre-opening income and
expenses for other ﬁnancial reporting purposes: (1) Pre-
opening income and expenses for the entire period from
the holding company’s inception through the date the
holding company commences operations should be
reported in the appropriate items of Schedule HI, Con-
solidated Report of Income, each quarter during the
calendar year in which operations commence; or (2) The
net amount of pre-opening income and expenses for the
period from the holding company’s inception until the
beginning of the calendar year in which the holding
company commences operations should be included,
along with the holding company’s opening (original)
equity capital, in Schedule HI-A, item 14, ‘‘Other adjust-
ments to equity capital (not included above).’’ The net
amount of these pre-opening income and expenses should
be identiﬁed and described in the ‘‘Notes to the Income
Statement.’’ Pre-opening income earned and expenses
incurred during the calendar year in which the holding
company commences operations should be reported in
the appropriate items of Schedule HI, Consolidated
Report of Income, each quarter during the calendar year

Subordinated Notes and Debentures: A subordinated
note or debenture is a form of debt issued by a holding
company or its subsidiaries. When issued by a subsidiary
bank, a subordinated note or debenture is not insured by a
federal agency, is subordinated to the claims of deposi-
tors, has an original weighted average maturity of ﬁve
years or more. Such debt shall be issued by a bank with
the approval of, or under the rules and regulations of, the
appropriate federal bank supervisory agency (i.e., the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation).
When issued by a holding company or its consolidated
nonbank subsidiaries, a subordinated note or debenture is
a form of unsecured long-term debt that is subordinated
to other debt of the consolidated holding company.
Both notes and debentures subordinated to deposits and
other subordinated notes and debentures of the holding
company are to be reported in Schedule HC, item 19(a),
‘‘Subordinated notes and debentures.’’
Subsidiaries: The treatment of subsidiaries in the FR
Y-9C depends upon the degree of ownership held by the
reporting holding company.
The term ‘‘subsidiary’’ is deﬁned under Section 225. 2 of
Federal Reserve Regulation Y, which generally includes
companies 25 percent or more owned or controlled by
another company. For savings and loan holding compa-
nies the term ‘‘subsidiary,’’ is deﬁned by Section 238.2
of Federal Reserve Regulation LL, which generally
includes companies more than 25 percent owned or
controlled by another company. However, for purposes of
the Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Com-
panies, a subsidiary is a company in which the parent
holding company directly or indirectly owns more than
50 percent of the outstanding voting stock.
An associated company is a corporation in which the
holding company, directly or indirectly, owns 20 to 50 per-
cent of the outstanding voting stock and over which the
holding company exercises signiﬁcant inﬂuence. This 20
to 50 percent ownership is presumed to carry ‘‘signiﬁ-
cant’’ inﬂuence unless the holding company can demon-
strate the contrary to the satisfaction of the Federal
Reserve.
A corporate joint venture is a corporation owned and
operated by a group of companies (‘‘joint venturers’’), no
one of which has a majority interest, as a separate and
speciﬁc business or project for the mutual beneﬁt of the
joint venturers. Each joint venturer may participate,
directly or indirectly, in the management of the joint
venture. An entity that is a majority-owned subsidiary
of one of the joint venturers is not a corporate joint
venture.
Certain subsidiaries (as speciﬁed in the General Instruc-
tions section of this book) must be consolidated on the
FR Y-9C. The equity ownership in subsidiaries that are
not consolidated on the FR Y-9C and in associated
companies is accounted for using the equity method of
accounting and is reported in Schedule HC, item 8,
“Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and associ-
ated companies.”
Ownership in a corporate joint venture is to be treated in
the same manner as an associated company (deﬁned
above) only to the extent that the equity share represents
signiﬁcant inﬂuence over management. Otherwise, equity
holdings in a joint venture are treated as holdings of
corporate stock and income is recognized only when
distributed in the form of dividends.
“Super NOW” Account: See “Deposits.”
Suspense Accounts: Suspense accounts are temporary
holding accounts in which items are carried until they can
be identiﬁed and their disposition to the proper account
can be made. The items included in these accounts should
be reviewed and should be reported in the appropriate
accounts of the FR Y-9C.
Syndications: A syndication is a participation, usually
involving shares in a single loan, in which several
participants agree to enter into an extension of credit
under a bona ﬁde binding agreement that provides that,
regardless of any even each participant shall fund and be
at risk only up to a speciﬁed percentage of the total
extension of credit or up to a speciﬁed dollar amount. In a
syndication, the participants agree to the terms of the
participation prior to the execution of the ﬁnal agreement
and the contract is executed by the obligor and by all the
participants, although there is usually a lead institution
organizing or managing the credit. Large commercial and
industrial loans, large loans to ﬁnance companies, and
large foreign loans may be handled through such syndi-
cated participations.
Each participant in the syndicate, including the lead bank
of the holding company, records its own share of the
participated loan and the total amount of the loan is not

entered on the books of one bank to be shared through
transfers of loans. Thus, the initial operation and distribu-
tion of this type of participation does not require a
determination as to whether a transfer that should be
accounted for as a sale has occurred. However, any
subsequent transfers of shares, or parts of shares, in the
syndicated loan would be subject to the provisions of
ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing (formerly FASB
Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servic-
ing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabili-
ties, as amended), governing whether these transfers
should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing.
(See the Glossary entry for “Transfers of Financial
Assets.”)
Telephone Transfer Account: See “Deposits.”
Term Federal Funds: See “Federal Funds Transac-
tions.”
Time Deposits: See “Deposits.”
Trade Date and Settlement Date Accounting: Trans-
actions in securities and trading account assets (including
money market instruments) should be reported on the
basis of trade date accounting in accordance with gener-
ally accepted accounting principles. However, if the
reported amounts under settlement date accounting would
not be materially different from those under trade date
accounting, settlement date accounting is acceptable.
Whichever method a holding company elects should be
used consistently, unless the holding company has elected
settlement date accounting and subsequently decides to
change to the preferred trade date method.
Under trade date accounting, assets purchased shall be
recorded in the appropriate asset category on the trade
date and the holding company’s (or its consolidated
subsidiaries’) obligation to pay for those assets shall be
reported in “Other liabilities.” Conversely, when an asset
is sold, it shall be removed on the trade date from the
asset category in which it was recorded, and the proceeds
receivable resulting from the sale shall be reported in
“Other assets.” Any gain or loss resulting from such
transaction shall also be recognized on the trade date. On
the settlement date, disbursement of the payment or
receipt of the proceeds will eliminate the respective
“Other liability” or “Other asset” entry resulting from the
transaction.
Under settlement date accounting, assets purchased are
not recorded until settlement date. On the trade date, no
entries are made. Upon receipt of the assets on the
settlement date, the asset is reported in the proper asset
category and payment is disbursed. The selling holding
company (or its consolidated subsidiaries) on the trade
date, would make no entries. On settlement date, the
selling holding company would reduce the appropriate
asset category and reﬂect the receipt of the payment. Any
gain or loss resulting from such transaction would be
recognized on the settlement date.
Trading Account: Trading activities typically include
(a) regularly underwriting or dealing in securities; inter-
est rate, foreign exchange rate, commodity, equity, and
credit derivative contracts; other ﬁnancial instruments;
and other assets for resale, (b) acquiring or taking
positions in such items principally for the purpose of
selling in the near term or otherwise with the intent to
resell in order to proﬁt from short-term price movements,
and (c) acquiring or taking positions in such items as an
accommodation to customers, provided that acquiring or
taking such positions meets the deﬁnition of “trading” in
ASC Topic 320, Investments–Debt Securities, and ASC
Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and the deﬁnition of
“trading purposes” in ASC Topic 815.
For purposes of the Consolidated Financial Statement for
Holding Companies, all debt securities within the scope
of ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securi-
ties, that a holding company has elected to report at fair
value under a fair value option with changes in fair value
reported in current earnings should be classiﬁed as
trading securities.
In addition, for purposes of these reports, holding compa-
nies may classify assets (other than securities within the
scope of ASC Topic 320 for which a fair value option is
elected) and liabilities as trading if the holding company
applies fair value accounting, with changes in fair value
reported in current earnings, and manages these assets
and liabilities as trading positions, subject to the controls
and applicable regulatory guidance related to trading
activities.
For example, a holding company would generally not
classify a loan to which it has applied the fair value
option as a trading asset unless the holding company
holds the loan, which it manages as a trading position, for
one of the following purposes: (1) for market making
activities, including such activities as accumulating loans
for sale or securitization; (2) to beneﬁt from actual or
Glossary

expected price movements; or (3) to lock in arbitrage
proﬁts.
All trading assets should be segregated from a holding
company’s other assets and reported in Schedule HC,
item 5, “Trading assets. In addition, holding companies
that reported average trading assets (Schedule HC-K,
item 4(a)) of $2 million or more in any of the four
preceding calendar quarters should detail the types of
assets and liabilities in the trading account in Schedule
HC-D, Trading Assets and Liabilities, and the levels
within the fair value measurement hierarchy in which the
trading assets and liabilities fall in Schedule HC-Q,
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
on a Recurring Basis. A holding company’s failure to
establish a separate account for assets that are used for
trading purposes does not prevent such assets from being
designated as trading for purposes of this report. For
further information, see ASC Topic 320.
All trading account assets should be reported at their fair
value as deﬁned by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measure-
ment, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in
Schedule HI, item 5c, “Trading revenue.” When a security
or other asset is acquired, a holding company should
determine whether it intends to hold the asset for trading
or for investment (e.g., for debt securities, available-for-
sale or held-to-maturity). A holding company should not
record a newly acquired asset in a suspense account and
later determine whether it was acquired for trading or
investment purposes. Regardless of how a holding com-
pany categorizes a newly acquired asset, management
should document its decision.
All trading liabilities should be segregated from other
transactions and reported in Schedule HC, item 15,
“Trading liabilities.” The trading liability account includes
the fair value of derivative contracts held for trading that
are in loss positions and short positions arising from sales
of securities and other assets that the holding company
does not own, or sales of more of a security or other asset
than the holding company owns. (See the Glossary entry
for “Short Position.”) Trading account liabilities should
be reported at fair value as deﬁned by ASC Topic 820
with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Sched-
ule HI, item 5c, “Trading revenue.”
Given the nature of the trading account, transfers into or
from the trading category should be rare. Transfers
between a trading account and any other account of the
holding company must be recorded at fair value at the
time of the transfer. For a security transferred from the
trading category, the unrealized holding gain or loss at
the date of the transfer will already have been recognized
in earnings and should not be reversed. For a security
transferred into the trading category, the unrealized hold-
ing gain or loss at the date of the transfer should be
recognized in earnings.
Transaction Account: See “Deposits.”
Transfers of Financial Assets: The accounting and
reporting standards for transfers of ﬁnancial assets are set
forth in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. Hold-
ing companies must follow ASC Topic 860 for purposes
of these reports. ASC Topic 860 limits the circumstances
in which a ﬁnancial asset, or a portion of a ﬁnancial asset,
should be derecognized when the transferor has not
transferred the entire original ﬁnancial asset or when the
transferor has continuing involvement with the trans-
ferred ﬁnancial asset. ASC Topic 860 also deﬁnes a
‘‘participating interest’’ (which is discussed more fully
below) and collectively establish the accounting and
reporting standards for loan participations, syndications,
and other transfers of portions of ﬁnancial assets. A
summary of these accounting and reporting standards
follows. For further information, see ASC Topic 860.
A ﬁnancial asset is cash, evidence of an ownership
interest in another entity, or a contract that conveys to the
holding company a contractual right either to receive
cash or another ﬁnancial instrument from another entity
or to exchange other ﬁnancial instruments on potentially
favorable terms with another entity. Most of the assets on
a holding company’s balance sheet are ﬁnancial assets,
including balances due from depository institutions, secu-
rities, federal funds sold, securities purchased under
agreements to resell, loans and lease ﬁnancing receiv-
ables, and interest-only strips receivable.28 However,
servicing assets are not ﬁnancial assets. Financial assets
also include ﬁnancial futures contracts, forward con-
tracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate
ﬂoors, and certain option contracts.
A transferor is an entity that transfers a ﬁnancial asset, an
interest in a ﬁnancial asset, or a group of ﬁnancial assets
that it controls to another entity. A transferee is an entity
28. ASC Topic 860 deﬁnes an interest-only strip receivable as the
contractual right to receive some or all of the interest due on a bond,
mortgage loan, collateralized mortgage obligation, or other interest-bearing
ﬁnancial asset.

that receives a ﬁnancial asset, an interest in a ﬁnancial
asset, or a group of ﬁnancial assets from a transferor.
In determining whether a holding company has surren-
dered control over transferred ﬁnancial assets, the hold-
ing company must ﬁrst consider whether the entity to
which the ﬁnancial assets were transferred would be
required to be consolidated by the holding company. If it
is determined that consolidation would be required by the
holding company, then the transferred ﬁnancial assets
would not be treated as having been sold in the FR Y-9C
report even if all of the other provisions listed below are
met.29
Determining Whether a Transfer Should be Accounted
for as a Sale or a Secured Borrowing - A transfer of an
entire ﬁnancial asset, a group of entire ﬁnancial assets, or
a participating interest in an entire ﬁnancial asset in
which the transferor surrenders control over those ﬁnan-
cial assets shall be accounted for as a sale if and only if
all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The transferred ﬁnancial assets have been isolated
from the transferor, i.e., put presumptively beyond
the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in
bankruptcy or other receivership. Transferred ﬁnan-
cial assets are isolated in bankruptcy or other receiv-
ership only if the transferred ﬁnancial assets would
be beyond the reach of the powers of a bankruptcy
trustee or other receiver for the transferor or any of
its consolidated affiliates included in the ﬁnancial
statements being presented. For multiple step trans-
fers, an entity that is designed to make remote the
possibility that it would enter bankruptcy or other
receivership (bankruptcy-remote entity) is not con-
sidered a consolidated affiliate for purposes of per-
forming the isolation analysis. Notwithstanding the
isolation analysis, each entity involved in the transfer
is subject to the applicable guidance on whether it
must be consolidated.
(2) Each transferee (or, if the transferee is an entity
whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization or
asset-backed ﬁnancing activities and that entity is
constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it
receives, each third-party holder of its beneﬁcial
interest) has the right to pledge or exchange the
assets (or beneﬁcial interests) it received, and no
condition both constrains the transferee (or third-
party holder of its beneﬁcial interests) from taking
advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and
provides more than a trivial beneﬁt to the transferor.
(3) The transferor, its consolidated affiliates included in
the ﬁnancial statements being presented, or its agents
do not maintain effective control over the transferred
ﬁnancial assets or third-party beneﬁcial interests
related to those transferred assets. Examples of a
transferor’s effective control over the transferred
ﬁnancial assets include, but are not limited to (a) an
agreement that both entitles and obligates the
transferor to repurchase or redeem the transferred
ﬁnancial assets before their maturity, (b) an agree-
ment that provides the transferor with both the
unilateral ability to cause the holder to return speciﬁc
ﬁnancial assets and a more-than-trivial beneﬁt attrib-
utable to that ability, other than through a cleanup
call, or (c) an agreement that permits the transferee to
require the transferor to repurchase the transferred
ﬁnancial assets at a price that is so favorable to the
transferee that it is probable that the transferee will
require the transferor to repurchase them.
If a transfer of an entire ﬁnancial asset, a group of entire
ﬁnancial assets, or a participating interest in an entire
ﬁnancial asset does not meet the conditions for sale
treatment, or if a transfer of a portion of an entire
ﬁnancial interest does not meet the deﬁnition of a partici-
pating interest (discussed below), the transferor and the
transferee shall account for the transfer as a secured
borrowing with pledge of collateral. The transferor shall
continue to report the transferred ﬁnancial assets in its
ﬁnancial statements with no change in their measurement
(i.e., the original basis of accounting for the transferred
ﬁnancial assets is retained).
Accounting for a Transfer of an Entire Financial Asset or
a Group of Entire Financial Assets That Qualiﬁes as a
Sale30 - Upon the completion of a transfer of an entire
ﬁnancial asset or a group of entire ﬁnancial assets that
satisﬁes all three of the conditions to be accounted for as

should be applied to determine when a variable interest entity should be
consolidated. For further information, refer to the Glossary entry for
“variable interest entity.”

a transfer of a participating interest in an entire ﬁnancial asset that qualiﬁes
as a sale. The accounting for such a transfer is discussed in a separate
section later in this Glossary entry.

a sale, the transferee(s) (i.e., purchaser(s)) must recog-
nize all assets obtained and any liabilities incurred and
initially measure them at fair value. The transferor (seller)
should:
(1) Derecognize or remove the transferred ﬁnancial
assets from the balance sheet.
(2) Recognize and initially measure at fair value servic-
ing assets, servicing liabilities, and any other assets
obtained (including a transferor’s beneﬁcial interest
in the transferred ﬁnancial assets) and liabilities
incurred in the sale.
(3) Recognize in earnings any gain or loss on the sale.
If, as a result of a change in circumstances, a holding
company transferor regains control of a transferred ﬁnan-
cial asset after a transfer that was previously accounted
for as a sale because one or more of the conditions for
sale accounting in ASC Topic 860 are no longer met or a
transferred portion of an entire ﬁnancial asset no longer
meets the deﬁnition of a participating interest, such a
change generally should be accounted for in the same
manner as a purchase of the transferred ﬁnancial asset
from the former transferee (purchaser) in exchange for a
liability assumed. The transferor should recognize
(rebook) the ﬁnancial asset on its balance sheet together
with a liability to the former transferee, measuring the
asset and liability at fair value on the date of the change
in circumstances. If the rebooked ﬁnancial asset is a loan,
it must be reported as a loan in Schedule HC-C, either as
a loan held for sale or a loan held for investment, based
on facts and circumstances, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The liability to the for-
mer transferee should be reported as a secured borrowing
in Schedule HC, item 16, ‘‘Other borrowings.’’ This
accounting and reporting treatment applies, for example,
to U.S. Government-guaranteed or -insured residential
mortgage loans backing Government National Mortgage
Association (GNMA) mortgage-backed securities that a
holding company services after it has securitized the
loans in a transfer accounted for as a sale. If and when
individual loans later meet delinquency criteria speciﬁed
by GNMA, they are eligible for repurchase (buy-back)
and the holding company is deemed to have regained
effective control over these loans. The delinquent loans
must be brought back onto the holding company’s books
and recorded as loans, regardless of whether the holding
company intends to exercise the buy-back option.
Holding companies should refer to ASC Topic 860 for
implementation guidance for accounting for transfers of
certain lease receivables, securities lending transactions,
repurchase agreements including “dollar rolls,” “wash
sales,” loan syndications, loan participations (discussed
below), risk participations in bankers acceptances, factor-
ing arrangements, and transfers of receivables with
recourse. However, these standards do not provide guid-
ance on the accounting for most assets and liabilities
recorded on the balance sheet following a transfer
accounted for as a sale. As a result, after their initial
measurement or carrying amount allocation, these assets
and liabilities should be accounted for in accordance with
the existing generally accepted accounting principles
applicable to them.
Participating Interests — Before considering whether
the conditions to be accounted for as a sale have been met
(as discussed above), the transfer of a portion of an entire
ﬁnancial asset must ﬁrst meet the deﬁnition of a partici-
pating interest. If the transferred portion of the entire
ﬁnancial asset is a qualifying participating interest (as
deﬁned below), then it should be determined whether the
transfer of the participating interest meets the sales
conditions discussed above. A participating interest in an
entire ﬁnancial asset, as deﬁned by ASC Topic 860, has
all of the following characteristics:
(1) From the date of the transfer, it must represent a
proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an
entire ﬁnancial asset;
(2) From the date of the transfer, all cash ﬂows received
from the entire ﬁnancial asset, except any cash ﬂows
allocated as compensation for servicing or other
services performed (which must not be subordinated
and must not signiﬁcantly exceed an amount that
would fairly compensate a substitute service provider
should one be required), must be divided proportion-
ately among the participating interest holders in an
amount equal to their share of ownership;
(3) The rights of each participating interest holder (includ-
ing the lead lender) must have the same priority, no
interest is subordinated to another interest, and no
participating interest holder has recourse to the lead
lender or another participating interest holder other
than standard representations and warranties and
ongoing contractual servicing and administration
obligations; and
Glossary
FR Y-9C
GL-97
Glossary
September 2020

(4) No party has the right to pledge or exchange the
entire ﬁnancial asset unless all participating interest
holders agree to do so.
Thus, under ASC Topic 860, so-called ‘‘last-in, ﬁrst-out’’
(LIFO) participations in which all principal cash ﬂows
collected on the loan are paid ﬁrst to the party acquiring
the participation do not meet the deﬁnition of a partici-
pating interest. Similarly, so-called ‘‘ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out’’
(FIFO) participations in which all principal cash ﬂows
collected on the loan are paid ﬁrst to the lead lender do
not meet the deﬁnition of a participating interest. As a
result, neither LIFO nor FIFO participations transferred
on or after the beginning of a holding company’s ﬁrst
annual reporting period that begins after November 15,
2009 (i.e., January 1, 2010, for a holding company with a
calendar year ﬁscal year) will qualify for sale accounting
and instead must be reported as secured borrowings.
The participating interest deﬁnition also applies to trans-
fers of government-guaranteed portions of loans, such as
those guaranteed by the Small Business Administration
(SBA). In this regard, for a transfer of the guaranteed
portion of an SBA loan at a premium that settled before
February 15, 2011, the “seller” was obligated by the SBA
to refund the premium to the “purchaser” if the loan was
repaid within 90 days of the transfer. This premium
refund obligation was a form of recourse, which meant
that the transferred guaranteed portion of the loan did not
meet the deﬁnition of a “participating interest” for the
90-day period that the premium refund obligation existed.
As a result, the transfer was required to be accounted for
as a secured borrowing during this period. After the
90-day period, assuming the transferred guaranteed por-
tion and the retained unguaranteed portion of the SBA
loan then met the deﬁnition of a “participating interest,”
the transfer of the guaranteed portion could be accounted
for as a sale if all of the conditions for sale accounting
were met. In contrast, for transfers of guaranteed portions
of SBA loans at a premium that settled on or after
February 15, 2011, the SBA has eliminated the premium
refund requirement. With the elimination of the premium
refund obligation from such transfers, the transferred
guaranteed portion and the retained unguaranteed portion
of the SBA loan should normally meet the deﬁnition of a
“participating interest” on the transfer date. Assuming
the deﬁnition of “participating interest” is met and all of
the conditions for sale accounting are met, the transfer of
the guaranteed portion of an SBA loan at a premium on
or after February 15, 2011, would qualify as a sale on the
transfer date. The conditions for sale accounting are
described above under “Determining Whether a Transfer
Should be Accounted for as a Sale or a Secured Borrow-
ing” in this Glossary entry.
In contrast, if the guaranteed portion of the SBA loan is
transferred at par in a so-called ’’par sale’’ in which the
’’seller’’ agrees to pass interest through to the ’’purchaser’’
at less than the contractual interest rate and the spread
between the contractual rate and the pass-through interest
rate signiﬁcantly exceeds an amount that would fairly
compensate a substitute servicer, the excess spread is
viewed as an interest-only strip. The existence of this
interest-only strip results in a disproportionate sharing of
the cash ﬂows on the entire SBA loan, which means that
the transferred guaranteed portion and the retained
unguaranteed portion of the SBA loan do not meet the
deﬁnition of a ’’participating interest,’’ which precludes
sale accounting. Instead, the transfer of the guaranteed
portion must be accounted for as a secured borrowing.
Accounting for a Transfer of a Participating Interest That
Qualiﬁes as a Sale — Upon the completion of a transfer
of a participating interest that satisﬁes all three of the
conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the participating
institution(s) (the transferee(s)) shall recognize the par-
ticipating interest(s) obtained, other assets obtained, and
any liabilities incurred and initially measure them at fair
value. The originating lender (the transferor) must:
(1) Allocate the previous carrying amount of the entire
ﬁnancial asset between the participating interest(s)
sold and the participating interest that it continues to
hold based on their relative fair values at the date of
the transfer.
(2) Derecognize the participating interest(s) sold.
(3) Recognize and initially measure at fair value servic-
ing assets, servicing liabilities, and any other assets
obtained and liabilities incurred in the sale.
(4) Recognize in earnings any gain or loss on the sale.
(5) Report any participating interest(s) that continue to
be held by the originating lender as the difference
between the previous carrying amount of the entire
ﬁnancial asset and the amount derecognized.
Additional Considerations Pertaining to Participating
Interests — When evaluating whether the transfer of a
participating interest in an entire ﬁnancial asset satisﬁes
the conditions for sale accounting under ASC Topic 860,
Glossary
GL-98
FR Y-9C
Glossary

an originating lender’s right of ﬁrst refusal on a bona ﬁde
offer to the participating institution from a third party, a
requirement for a participating institution to obtain the
originating lender’s permission to sell or pledge the
participating interest that shall not be unreasonably with-
held, or a prohibition on the participating institution’s
sale of the participating interest to the originating lend-
er’s competitor (if other potential willing buyers exist) is
a limitation on the participating institution’s rights, but is
presumed not to constrain a participant from exercising
its right to pledge or exchange the participating interest.
However, if the participation agreement constrains the
participating institution from pledging or exchanging its
participating interest, the originating lender presump-
tively receives more than a trivial beneﬁt, has not relin-
quished control over the participating interest, and should
account for the transfer of the participating interest as a
secured borrowing.
A loan participation agreement may give the originating
lender the contractual right to repurchase a participating
interest at any time. In this situation, the right to repur-
chase is effectively a call option on a speciﬁc participat-
ing interest, i.e., a participating interest that is not readily
obtainable in the marketplace. Regardless of whether this
option is freestanding or attached, it either constrains the
participating institution from pledging or exchanging its
participating interest or results in the originating lender
maintaining effective control over the participating inter-
est. As a consequence, the contractual right to repurchase
precludes sale accounting and the transfer of the partici-
pating interest should be accounted for as a secured
borrowing, not as a sale.
In addition, under a loan participation agreement, the
originating lender may give the participating institution
the right to resell the participating interest, but reserves
the right to call the participating interest at any time from
whoever holds it and can enforce that right by discontinu-
ing the ﬂow of interest to the holder of the participating
interest at the call date. In this situation, the originating
lender has maintained effective control over the partici-
pating interest and the transfer of the participating inter-
est should be accounted for as a secured borrowing, not
as a sale.
When an originating FDIC-insured lender transfers a
loan participation with recourse after December 31,
2001, the participation generally will not be considered
isolated from the transferor, i.e., the originating lender, in
the event of an FDIC receivership. Section 360.6 of the
FDIC’s regulations limits the FDIC’s ability to reclaim
loan participations transferred ‘‘without recourse,’’ as
deﬁned in the regulations, but does not limit the FDIC’s
ability to reclaim loan participations transferred with
recourse. Under Section 360.6, a participation that is
subject to an agreement that requires the originating
lender to repurchase the participation or to otherwise
compensate the participating institution due to a default
on the underlying loan is considered a participation
‘‘with recourse.’’ As a result, a loan participation trans-
ferred ‘‘with recourse’’ after December 31, 2001, gener-
ally should be accounted for as a secured borrowing and
not as a sale for ﬁnancial reporting purposes. This means
that the originating lender should not remove the partici-
pation from its loan assets on the balance sheet, but
should report the secured borrowing in Schedule HC,
item 16, ‘‘Other borrowings.’’
Reporting Transfers of Loan Participations That Do Not
Qualify for Sale Accounting — If a transfer of a portion
of an entire ﬁnancial asset does not meet the deﬁnition of
a participating interest, or if a transfer of a participating
interest does not meet all of the conditions for sale
accounting under ASC Topic 860, the transfer must be
reported as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral.
In these situations, because the transferred loan participa-
tion does not qualify for sale accounting under ASC
Topic 860, the originating lender must continue to report
the transferred participation (as well as the retained
portion of the loan) as a loan on the balance sheet
(Schedule HC), normally in item 4(b), “Loans and leases,
held for investment,” and in the appropriate loan cate-
gory in Schedule HC-C, Loans and Lease Financing
Receivables. The originating lender should report the
transferred loan participation as a secured borrowing on
the balance sheet in Schedule HC, item 16, “Other
borrowed money,” and in the appropriate subitem or
subitems in Schedule HC-M, item 14, “Other borrowed
money;” in Schedule HC-M, item 23(b), “Amount of
’Other borrowings’ that are secured;” and in Schedule
HC-C, Memorandum item 14, “Pledged loans and leases.”
As a consequence, the transferred loan participation
should be included in the originating lender’s loans and
leases for purposes of determining the appropriate level
for the lender’s allowance for credit losses.
A holding company that acquires a nonqualifying loan
participation (or a qualifying participating interest in a
transfer that does not does not meet all of the conditions

for sale accounting) should normally report the loan
participation or participating interest in item 4(b), ‘‘Loans
and leases, held for investment,’’ on the balance sheet
(Schedule HC) and in the loan category appropriate to the
underlying loan, e.g., as a ‘‘commercial and industrial
loan’’ in item 4 or as a ‘‘loan secured by real estate’’ in
item 1, in Schedule HC-C, Loans and Lease Financing
Receivables. Furthermore, for risk-based capital pur-
poses, the acquiring holding company should assign the
loan participation or participating interest to the risk-
weight category appropriate to the underlying borrower
or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collat-
eral.
Purchased Loans Originated By Others- Some holding
companies have entered into various residential mortgage
loan purchase programs. These programs often function
like traditional warehouse lines of credit; however, in
some cases, the mortgage loan transfers are legally
structured as purchases by the holding company rather
than as pledges of collateral to secure the funding. Under
these programs, a holding company provides funding to a
mortgage loan originator while simultaneously obtaining
an interest in the mortgage loans subject to a takeout
commitment. A takeout commitment is a written commit-
ment from an approved investor (generally, an unrelated
third party) to purchase one or more mortgage loans from
the originator.
Although the facts and circumstances of each program
must be carefully evaluated to determine the appropriate
accounting, an institution should generally account for a
mortgage purchase program with continuing involvement
by the originator, including takeout commitments, as a
secured borrowing with pledge of collateral, i.e., a loan to
the originator secured by the residential mortgage loans,
rather than a purchase of mortgage loans.
When loans obtained in a mortgage purchase program do
not qualify for sale accounting, the ﬁnancing provided to
the originator (if not held for trading purposes) should be
reported in Schedule HC-C, Part I, item 9.a, “Loans to
nondepository ﬁnancial institutions,” and on the balance
sheet in Schedule HC, item 4.a, “Loans and leases held
for sale,” or item 4.b, “Loans and leases, net of unearned
income,” as appropriate. For risk-based capital purposes,
a loan to a mortgage loan originator secured by residen-
tial mortgages that is reported in Schedule HC-C, Part I,
item 9.a, should be assigned a 100 percent risk weight, or
if relevant, the risk weight category appropriate to the
exposure as discussed in the regulatory capital rules, and
included in the appropriate column of Schedule HC-R,
Part II, item 4.d or 5.d, based on its balance sheet
classiﬁcation.
In situations where the transaction between the mortgage
loan originator and the transferee (acquiring) holding
company is accounted for as a secured borrowing with
pledge of collateral, the transferee (acquiring) holding
company’s designation of the ﬁnancing provided to the
originator as held for sale is appropriate only when the
conditions in ASC Subtopic 310-10, Receivables - Over-
all, and the 2001 Interagency Guidance on Certain Loans
Held for Sale have been met. In these situations, the
mortgage loan originator’s planned sale of the pledged
collateral (i.e., the individual residential mortgage loans)
to a takeout investor is not relevant to the transferee
institution’s designation of the loan to the originator as
held for investment or held for sale. In situations where
the transferee institution simultaneously extends a loan to
the originator and transfers an interest (for example, a
participation interest) in the loan to the originator to
another party, the transfer to the other party also should
be evaluated to determine whether the conditions in ASC
Topic 860 for sale accounting treatment have been met. If
this transfer qualiﬁes to be accounted for as a sale, the
portion of the loan to the originator that is retained by the
transferee institution should be classiﬁed as held for
investment when the transferee has the intent and ability
to hold that portion for the foreseeable future or until
maturity or payoff (which is generally in the near term).
Financial Assets Subject to Prepayment — Financial
assets such as interest-only strips receivable, other ben-
eﬁcial interests, loans, debt securities, and other receiv-
ables, but excluding ﬁnancial instruments that must be
accounted for as derivatives, that can contractually be
prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder
of the ﬁnancial asset would not recover substantially all
of its recorded investment do not qualify to be accounted
for at amortized cost. After their initial recording on the
balance sheet, ﬁnancial assets of this type must be
subsequently measured at fair value like available-for-
sale securities or trading securities.

Treasury Stock: Treasury stock is stock that the holding
company has issued and subsequently acquired, but that
has not been retired or resold. As a general rule, treasury
Glossary
GL-100
FR Y-9C
Glossary
March 2024

stock is to be carried at cost and is a deduction from a
holding company’s total equity capital.
For purposes of this report, the carrying value of treasury
stock should be reported (as a negative number) in
Schedule HC, item 26(c), “Other equity capital compo-
nents.”
“Gains” and “losses” on the sale, retirement, or other
disposal of treasury stock are not to be reported in
Schedule HI, Income Statement, but should be reﬂected
in Schedule HI-A, items 7 and 8, “Sale of treasury stock,”
and “Purchase of treasury stock.” Such gains and losses,
as well as the excess of the cost over the par value of
treasury stock carried at par, are generally to be treated as
adjustments to Schedule HC, item 25, “Surplus.”
For further information, see ASC Subtopic 505-30,
Equity – Treasury Stock.
Trust Preferred Securities as Investments: As holding
company investments, trust preferred securities are hybrid
instruments possessing characteristics typically associ-
ated with debt obligations. Although each issue of these
securities may involve minor differences in terms, under
the basic structure of trust preferred securities a corporate
issuer, such as a holding company, ﬁrst organizes a
business trust or other special purpose entity. This trust
issues two classes of securities: common securities, all of
which are purchased and held by the corporate issuer, and
trust preferred securities, which are sold to investors. The
business trust’s only assets are deeply subordinated
debentures of the corporate issuer, which the trust pur-
chases with the proceeds from the sale of its common and
preferred securities. The corporate issuer makes periodic
interest payments on the subordinated debentures to the
business trust, which uses these payments to pay periodic
dividends on the trust preferred securities to the inves-
tors. The subordinated debentures have a stated maturity
and may also be redeemed under other circumstances.
Most trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory
redemption upon the repayment of the debentures.
Trust preferred securities meet the deﬁnition of a security
in ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt Securities, and in
ASC Topic 321, Investments-Equity Securities. Because
of the mandatory redemption provision in the typical
trust preferred security, investments in trust preferred
securities would normally be considered debt securities
for ﬁnancial accounting purposes. Accordingly, regard-
less of the authority under which a holding company is
permitted to invest in trust preferred securities, holding
companies should report these investments as debt secu-
rities for purposes of these reports (unless, based on the
speciﬁc facts and circumstances of a particular issue of
trust preferred securities, the securities would be consid-
ered equity under ASC Topic 321, rather than debt
securities under ASC Topic 320). If not held for trading
purposes, trust preferred securities issued by U.S. busi-
ness trusts should be reported in Schedule HC-B,
item 6(a), “Other domestic debt securities.” If not held
for trading purposes, an investment in a structured ﬁnan-
cial product, such as a collateralized debt obligation, for
which the underlying collateral is a pool of trust preferred
securities issued by U.S. business trusts should be
reported in Schedule HC-B, item 5(b), “Structure ﬁnan-
cial products,” and in the appropriate subitem of Sched-
ule HC-B, Memorandum item 6, “Structured ﬁnancial
products by underlying collateral or reference assets.”
Trust Preferred Securities Issued: Trust preferred secu-
rities are marketed under a variety of names including
MIPS (‘‘Monthly Income Preferred Securities’’), QUIPS
(‘‘Quarterly Income Preferred Securities’’) and TOPrS
(‘‘Trust Originated Preferred Securities’’). These securi-
ties are generally issued out of special purpose entities
whose voting common stock is wholly owned by the
parent holding company. The proceeds from the issuance
of these securities are lent to the holding company in the
form of a very long term, deeply subordinated note.
Under GAAP, the special purpose entity may either be a
consolidated subsidiary of the holding company or a
deconsolidated entity that qualiﬁes as an unconsolidated
subsidiary of the holding company for regulatory report-
ing and other regulatory purposes.
Holding companies seeking to issue such securities
should consult with their Federal Reserve Bank. Under
the revised regulatory capital rule, TruPS are generally
considered non-qualifying capital instruments that must
be phased-out of tier 1 capital (see instructions for HC-R,
Part I, items 20, 21, 27, and 28). Note that the rule
permanently grandfathers non-qualifying capital instru-
ments in the tier 1 capital of depository institution
holding companies with total consolidated assets of less
than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, and 2010
Mutual Holding Companies (subject to limits and addi-
tional requirements in case of mergers and acquisitions).
Nonqualifying capital instruments under the rule include
TruPS and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued
before May 19, 2010, that BHCs included in tier 1 capital

under the limitations for restricted capital elements in the
general risk-based capital rules.
For purposes of reporting on the FR Y-9C, trust preferred
securities issued by a consolidated subsidiary should be
reported in Schedule HC, item 19(b).
For special purpose entities that issue trust preferred
securities and the entity is not consolidated, report the
amount of subordinated notes payable by the holding
company to the unconsolidated special purpose entity in
Schedule HC, item 19(b).
U.S. Banks: See ‘‘Banks, U.S. and foreign.’’
U.S. Territories and Possessions: United States territo-
ries and possessions include American Samoa, Guam, the
Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Valuation Allowance: A valuation allowance is an
account established against a speciﬁc asset category, or to
recognize a speciﬁc liability, with the intent of absorbing
some element of estimated loss. Such allowances are
created by charges to expense in the Report of Income for
Holding Companies and are netted from the asset accounts
to which they relate for presentation in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet in the FR Y-9C. Provisions establishing or
augmenting valuation allowances are to be reported in
Schedule HI, item 5.(l), as ‘‘Other noninterest expense’’
except for:
(1) Provisions for credit losses on ﬁnancial assets and
off-balance-sheet credit exposures within the scope
of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit
Losses, which are reported in Schedule HI. item 4,
“Provisions for credit losses,” and
(2) Provisions for declines in the fair value minus the
estimated costs to sell of a foreclosed real estate asset
below the asset’s cost, and subsequent recoveries of
such declines, which are to be reported in Sched-
ule HI, item 5.(j), “Net gains (losses) on sales of
other real estate owned.”
See also the Glossary entries for “Allowances for Credit
Losses” and “Foreclosed Assets.”
Variable Interest Entity: A variable interest entity
(VIE), as described in ASC Subtopic 810-10, Consolida-
tion – Overall, is an entity in which equity investors do
not have sufficient equity at risk for that entity to ﬁnance
its activities without additional subordinated ﬁnancial
support or, as a group, the holders of the equity invest-
ment at risk lack one or more of the following three
characteristics: (a) the power, through voting rights or
similar rights, to direct the activities of an entity that most
signiﬁcantly impact the entity’s economic performance,
(b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the
entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected residual
returns of the entity.
Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership, or
other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with
changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets
exclusive of variable interests. For example, equity own-
ership in a VIE would be a variable interest as long as the
equity ownership is considered to be at risk of loss.
ASC Subtopic 810-10 provides guidance for determining
when a holding company or other company must consoli-
date certain special purposes entities, such as VIEs.
Under ASC Subtopic 810-10, a holding company must
perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it
has a controlling ﬁnancial interest in a VIE. This must
include an assessment of the characteristics of the hold-
ing company’s variable interest or interests and other
involvements (including involvement of related parties
and de facto agents), if any, in the VIE, as well as the
involvement of other variable interest holders. The
assessment must also consider the entity’s purpose and
design, including the risks that the entity was designed to
create and pass through to its variable interest holders. In
making this assessment, only substantive terms, transac-
tions, and arrangements, whether contractual or noncon-
tractual, are to be considered. Any term, transaction, or
arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an
entity’s status as a VIE, the holding company’s power
over a VIE, or the holding company’s obligation to
absorb losses or its right to receive beneﬁts of the VIE are
to be disregarded when applying the provisions of ASC
Subtopic 810-10.
If a holding company has a controlling ﬁnancial interest
in a VIE, it is deemed to be the primary beneﬁciary of the
VIE and, therefore, must consolidate the VIE. An entity
is deemed to have a controlling ﬁnancial interest in a VIE
if it has both of the following characteristics:
• The power to direct the activities of a variable interest
entity that most signiﬁcantly impact the entity’s eco-
nomic performance.
• The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could
potentially be signiﬁcant to the variable interest entity
or the right to receive beneﬁts from the entity that
Glossary
GL-102
FR Y-9C
Glossary
December 2024

could potentially be signiﬁcant to the variable interest
entity.
If a holding company holds a variable interest in a VIE, it
must reassess each reporting period to determine whether
it is the primary beneﬁciary. Based on a holding com-
pany’s reassessment it may be required to consolidate or
deconsolidate the VIE if a change in the holding com-
pany’s status as the primary beneﬁciary has occurred.
ASC Subtopic 810-10 provide guidance on the initial
measurement of a VIE that the primary beneﬁciary must
consolidate. For example, if the primary beneﬁciary and
the VIE are not under common control, the initial consoli-
dation of a VIE that is a business is a business combina-
tion and must be accounted for in accordance with ASC
Topic 805, Business Combinations. If a holding company
is required to deconsolidate a VIE, it must follow the
guidance for deconsolidating subsidiaries in ASC Sub-
topic 810-10 (formerly FASB Statement No. 160, Non-
controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial State-
ments).
When a holding company is required to consolidate a
VIE because it is the primary beneﬁciary, the standard
principles of consolidation apply after initial measure-
ment (see ‘‘Rules of Consolidation’’ in the General
Instructions). The assets and liabilities of consolidated
VIEs should be reported on the balance sheet (Schedule
HC) in the balance sheet category appropriate to the asset
or liability. An institution that consolidates one or more
VIEs must complete Schedule HC-V, Variable Interest
Entities, to report, by balance sheet category, (a) the
assets of consolidated VIEs that can be used only to settle
obligations of the consolidated VIEs and (b) the liabili-
ties of consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have
recourse to the general credit of the reporting institution.
Such an institution also must report in Schedule HC-V
the total amount of assets and the total amount of
liabilities of its consolidated VIEs that do not meet these
criteria.
When-Issued Securities Transactions: Transactions
involving securities described as “when-issued” or “when-
as-and-if-issued” are, by their nature, conditional, i.e.,
their completion is contingent upon the issuance of the
securities. The accounting for contracts for the purchase
or sale of when-issued securities or other securities that
do not yet exist is addressed in ASC Topic 815, Deriva-
tives and Hedging. Such contracts are excluded from the
requirements of ASC Topic 815, as a regular-way secu-
rity trade only if:
(1) There is no other way to purchase or sell that
security;
(2) Delivery of that security and settlement will occur
within the shortest period possible for that type of
security; and
(3) It is probable at inception and throughout the term of
the individual contract that the contract will not settle
net and will result in physical delivery of a security
when it is issued.
A contract for the purchase or sale of when-issued
securities may qualify for the regular-way security trade
exclusion even though the contract permits net settlement
or a market mechanism to facilitate net settlement of the
contract exists (as described in ASC Topic 815). A
holding company should document the basis for conclud-
ing that it is probable that the contract will not settle net
and will result in physical delivery.
If a when-issued securities contract does not meet the
three criteria above, it should be accounted for as a
derivative at fair value on the balance sheet (Schedule
HC) and reported as a forward contract in Schedule
HC-L, item 11(b). Such contracts should be reported on a
gross basis on the balance sheet unless the criteria for
netting in ASC Subtopic 210-20, Balance Sheet – Offset-
ting (formerly FASB Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of
Amounts Related to Certain Contracts), are met. (See the
Glossary entry for ‘‘Offsetting’’ for further information.)
If a when-issued securities contract qualiﬁes for the
regular-way security trade exclusion, it is not accounted
for as a derivative. If the holding company accounts for
these contracts on a trade-date basis, it should recognize
the acquisition or disposition of the when-issued securi-
ties on its balance sheet (Schedule HC) at the inception of
the contract. If the holding company accounts for these
contracts on a settlement-date basis, contracts for the
purchase and sale of when-issued securities should be
reported as “Other off-balance sheet items” in Schedule
HC-L, item 9, subject to the existing reporting thresholds
for this item.
Trading in when-issued securities normally begins when
the U.S. Treasury or some other issuer of securities
announces a forthcoming issue. (In some cases, trading
may begin in anticipation of such an announcement and
should also be reported as described herein.) Since the
Glossary
FR Y-9C

Glossary

exact price and terms of the security are unknown before
the auction date, trading prior to that date is on a “yield”
basis. On the auction date the exact terms and price of the
security become known and when-issued trading contin-
ues until settlement date, when the securities are deliv-
ered and the issuer is paid. If physical delivery is taken on
settlement date and settlement date accounting is used,
the securities purchased by the holding company shall be
reported on the balance sheet as held-to-maturity securi-
ties in Schedule HC, item 2(a), available-for-sale securi-
ties in Schedule HC, item 2(b), or trading assets in
Schedule HC, item 5, as appropriate.
